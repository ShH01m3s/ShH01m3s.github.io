    <h2 id="first-amendment">First Amendment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protects the freedom of press. Also, other individuals are also free to express their opinion even if it differs from the gov&rsquo;s. But! There is a huge difference between an opinion and a statement.</p>
<p>A suspect that operates a website is a &ldquo;publisher&rdquo;, therefore, falls under the First Amendment&rsquo;s protection. They can publish anything <strong>as long as it&rsquo;s tru</strong>e and can be proven. Also, &ldquo;publishers&rdquo; can protect their sources. But they are obliged to testify. However, even under oath, they don&rsquo;t have to name their sources.</p>
<p>ISPs also have the right to protect their sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://casetext.com/case/ogrady-v-superior-court">Case</a>: O&rsquo;Grady v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72 - Cal: Court of Appeal, 6th Appellate Dist. 2006.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-amendment">Fourth Amendment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainly it means, that no one can just come around and snoop in your house üè° without a proper warrant issued by a judge. Not just house, of course. Illegal search is called <em>unreasonable</em> since you need a good reason to look around. There are some exceptions though:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the course of the arrest, searching the person&rsquo;s body, vehicle and belongings at the arrest scene, is <strong>not</strong> unreasonanble.</li>
<li>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not always a <em>search</em>. For example, if the person invites you into the house, you can look around. This is called a plain view <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_view_doctrine">doctrine</a> (see below). This is not a search. But if you open some drawer, this <em>is</em> a search.</li>
<li>If someone not from law enforcement comes and turns over the evidence, the government (officers) is not involved and therefore it&rsquo;s not considered illegal. This Amendment only protects the citizens from the law enforcement and the government, but not from other citizens (good or bas samaritans).</li>
<li>Also, if the officer has the suspect&rsquo;s perfmission to perform a search, it&rsquo;s also legal. Athough it&rsquo;s quite strange to me that someone would willingly let the police snoop through the house without a warrant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>, the <strong>plain view doctrine</strong> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Exceptions_to_the_warrant_requirement">exception</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)">warrant</a> requirement[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_view_doctrine#cite_note-1">1]</a> that allows an officer to seize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence">evidence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband">contraband</a> that are found in plain view during a lawful observation. The doctrine is also regularly used by TSA officers while screening persons and property at U.S. airports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warrants specify what, where and to what extent is supposed to be searched.</p>
<p>Private detectives should turn over the evidence found if they find them during their investigations. This is not illegal. But if the government agent asks to go and look for more (weird situation though) - you&rsquo;re suddenly becoming a government agent. Wow&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ve just found a legal way into the police force! Good&hellip; .</p>
<p><a href="https://casetext.com/case/us-v-carey-9">Case</a>: US v. Carey, 172 F. 3d 1268 - Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit 1999.</p>
<h2 id="fifth-amendment">Fifth Amendment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No person can be forced to testify against themselves. Therefore, information aqcuired under torture can not be used in court. If you&rsquo;re tricked - the same rule applies. The court has still not reached consensus on this one: does that rule apply to passwords? There are two ways to look at passwords from the legal aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>A password protected media is a container and a password is a key. That&rsquo;s somewhat close to the physical key and is not protected by this law since it&rsquo;s a regular thing to ask for a key from some room or drawer when you have a warrant to search the house.</li>
<li>A password from the media is more like a padlock or a combination key. Therefore, it&rsquo;s in the person&rsquo;s head. You can&rsquo;t force the person to give in the information from their head, since this falls under the 5th Amendment.</li>
</ul>
<p>However (it&rsquo;s my thought) that doesn&rsquo;t make much sence, since in the first case the person might be hiding the key and giving it in would mean revealing its place and it in turn can be considered forcing the person to provide some information they are not willing to provide. In my humble opinion the first on makes more sense. Just think about it. If I have a warrant to search the whole house, I have the right to search everything inside that house, including its rooms, wordrobes and drawers and stuff. I have also the right to search HDDs, PCs and mobile phones, since they are also inside that house. However, if the phone or other media has a password protecting it, my search that was guaranted by the warrant, cannot be fulfiled. I don&rsquo;t know if such thing even exists, but that would violate my &ldquo;investigator&rsquo;s rights&rdquo; üòÑ.</p>
