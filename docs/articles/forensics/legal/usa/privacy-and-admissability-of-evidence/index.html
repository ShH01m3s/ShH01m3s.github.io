  <div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There is some information that is considered privileged. This can be excluded from the legal search even if there is a warrant. What can a digital forensics investigator do wrong that would deem the evidence unusable? Not everyone is a government agent. At least, I am not.</p>
<p>There is no real and clear statement in the Constitution that would define and protect the right to privacy. Many amendments refer to this right, but it&rsquo;s not yet stated in the Constitution. Therefore, it&rsquo;s up to the judge to decide whether such rights exist.</p>
<p>However, the legislation has determined what right people have under what specific circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="the-privacy-act-of-1974---">The Privacy Act of 1974 👩 👨 🔐</h2>
<p>Before this act was created, one could just out of the blue ask a clert officer to give him or her another person&rsquo;s birth ceritifcate. This acts states two importnat things:</p>
<ul>
<li>No secret information archives may be kept, because the people were very much concerned what information the government and other organisations could collect about them.</li>
<li>I can get access to my information and docs, but other people can&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-electronic-communications-privacy-act-of-1986--">The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986  💻🔐</h2>
<p>The extension for the above but applied to the digital data. It states that electronic data should also be protected. Also adds the <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1285#specific-provisions">Wiretap act</a> that prohibits illegal interception.</p>
<p>Both of the above acts regulate how the government can or cannot use the information, but doesn&rsquo;t not affect private companies (banks, for example).</p>
<h2 id="the-fair-credit-reporting-act-of-1970-">The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 💵</h2>
<p>Protection of the person&rsquo;s credit worthiness. Defines who could and could not access it and the person can have the errors corrected.</p>
<h2 id="right-to-financial-privacy-act-of-1978-">Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 💵</h2>
<p>Limits the information that the gov can request from the financial institutions.</p>
<h2 id="the-gramm-leach-biley-act-of-1999-">The Gramm-Leach-Biley Act of 1999 💵</h2>
<p>How the information can be shared and used by the organisation. It says that one cannot pretend to be someone else to get data.</p>
<h2 id="fair-debt-collection-practices-act-of-2006-">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 2006 💵</h2>
<p>Protects the suspects from unscrupulous investigators. One cannot claim to be a debt collector in order to gain information and the financial information connected to the suspect&rsquo;s debts is also protected.</p>
<h2 id="the-health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 💉</h2>
<p>To obtain any information from any healt care organisation, one needs a subpoena. But these organisations can voluntarily provide the internation, there is no law that prohibits that especially if public safety is a concern.</p>
<h2 id="the-family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-of-2008-">The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 2008 🏫</h2>
<p>Regulate information that can be obtained from schools.</p>
<h2 id="attorneyclient-privilege">Attorney/Client Privilege</h2>
<p>Self-explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="doctorypatient-privilege">Doctory/Patient Privilege</h2>
<p>Self-explanatory. Depends on the state. Some of them do not recognise this privilege.</p>
<h2 id="workproduct-doctrine">Work/Product Doctrine</h2>
<p>Similar to Attorney/Client Privilege. Can be violated under certain circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="protected-intellectual-property">Protected Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>If the defendant proves that providing some information will violate their Intellectual Property, they may refuse giving in the data.</p>
<p>Taint Team. The one that sorts protected information. Legal experts and examiners with no vested interested in the case. Not all courts have these teams.</p>
<p>What makes evidence admissable in court?</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Must be relevant. Relates directly to the current case and does not prejudice the case with inflammatory information not related, even if true (for example, when someone is painting the defendant&rsquo;s character). It also has to be probative. If it helps find the truth.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Must be authentic and credible. Forensic investigator can be called to testify in court as an expert witness. They should prove that the evidence was really the suspect&rsquo;s and that it was not altered by anyone. Also,  were these evidence put there by the suspect? May be they were hacked? Or an accident?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Must be competent (that it was legally obtained and is true). It should not be unduly prejudice. Not restricted under any statetory restraints. The evidence collection was not violating Constitutional laws. It&rsquo;s not a hearsay info.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if the investigator breaks a rule?</p>
<p>The evidence might be excluded or lead to the mistrial. They might be legally liable&hellip;</p>
<p>Looks like there are lots of laws that protect people from the police but there are no laws that actually help the policy to investigate. If the person has nothing to hide, then why refuse to give the permission? This I will never understand. I don&rsquo;t think that the police officers would poke into other people&rsquo;s docs and chats just to have some funny story to tell to a friend over a beer 🍻. I would not want my private records to be read by someone either, but to help find a bad guy I would turn them over.</p>
