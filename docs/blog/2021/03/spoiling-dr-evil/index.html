<h2 id="case-objectives">Case Objectives</h2>
<p>On <code>09/20/04</code> , a Dell CPi notebook computer, serial # <code>VLQLW</code>, was found abandoned along with a wireless PCMCIA card and an external homemade 802.11b antennae. It is suspected that this computer was used for hacking purposes, although cannot be tied to a hacking suspect, G=r=e=g S=c=h=a=r=d=t. (The equal signs are just to prevent web crawlers from indexing this name; there are no equal signs in the image files.) <code>Schardt</code> also goes by the online nickname of <code>“Mr. Evil”</code> and some of his associates have said that he would park his vehicle within range of Wireless Access Points (like Starbucks and other T-Mobile Hotspots) where he would then intercept internet traffic, attempting to get credit card numbers, usernames &amp; passwords.</p>
<p>Find any hacking software, evidence of their use, and any data that might have been generated. Attempt to tie the computer to the suspect, G=r=e=g S=c=h=a=r=d=t.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-image-hash-does-the-acquisition-and-verification-hash-match">What is the image hash? Does the acquisition and verification hash match?</h3>
<p>📆  <code>01/03/2021</code></p>
<p>⏰  ​<code>21:41</code></p>
<p>Have spent quite a time to install Autopsy on MacOS and after loading the second image keep getting crashes 😩. Looks like I will have to install Windows VM&hellip;</p>
<p>⏰  <code>22:44</code></p>
<p>Had to write another blog <a href="">post</a> to get everything ready for this one&hellip; . Oh these <em>&ldquo;stacked function calls&rdquo;</em> in real life &hellip;. In order to get something done, do something else, which requires this and that to run and this and that is installed with dozens of bugs etc 🤢. But I&rsquo;ve finally managed to get it work (I mean Autopsy). Though didn&rsquo;t have enough time to test whether it crashed or not upon adding a resource. Well, that will be left for the next time. I&rsquo;m literally turning off.</p>
<p>📆  <code>03/03/2021</code></p>
<p>⏰  ​<code>08:49</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loaded the first disk image yesterday, but it&rsquo;s still not done analysing it&hellip; . Well, to be honest, I turned it off for the night, but still. It&rsquo;s still 55% only. Let&rsquo;s wait. Ok. it&rsquo;s just started working much faster than yesterday. Time to rewatch Autopsy course&hellip; .</p>
<p>⏰  <code>08:55</code></p>
<p>A very important note for people like me 🤦‍♀️  . When you see a series of files with extensions looking like this, for example: <code>e01</code>, <code>e02</code>, <code>e03</code> or <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, <code>003</code> etc, even though there are no  <code>e02</code>, <code>e03</code> or <code>002</code>, <code>003</code> in the real life, these numbers at the end indicate that these files are <strong>parts</strong> of the <strong>same</strong> image. To load it into Autopsy, just choose the <strong>first</strong> one (those ending with <code>1</code>, for example, <code>e01</code> or <code>001</code>). It took me a while to get this. See the <a href="https://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/3.1/ds_page.html">link</a>.</p>
<p>So, the first task is to check data source integrity. For <code>E01</code> files the hash is usually calculated upon acquisition, and <em>Autopsy</em> verifies it if you run a <em>Data Source Integrity</em> digest module against this image. In case the acquisition and the calculated hashes do <strong>not</strong> match, I will see and error under <em>Results -&gt; Extracted Content -&gt; Verification Failure</em>. In my case, there were no errors hence for the <code>E01</code> image the acquisition and verification hash do match.</p>
<p>Now to the second one. Along with the images I had a log file for <code>001</code> image where md5 hashes were calculated for each fragment during acquisition. I&rsquo;ve run <code>md5 SCHA*</code> command line against these files to calculate all md5 hashes for these images and got the results:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">MD5 <span class="o">(</span>SCHARDT.001<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> 28a9b613d6eefe8a0515ef0a675bdebd

</code></pre></div><p>And these are the values from the aquisition log:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">* SCHARDT.001 28A9B613 D6EEFE8A 0515EF0A 675BDEBD...

* SCHARDT.008 8194A79A 5356DF79 883AE2DC 7415929F
</code></pre></div><p>These match too.</p>
<p>Also, both data sources have the same general hash (for all fragments) - <code>aee4fcd9301c03b3b054623ca261959a</code> indicating that these images are the same image in two different formats.</p>
<p>🗒 One thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed is that <code>SCHARDT.006</code> and <code>SCHARDT.007</code> are identical. Mistake? Collision?</p>
<h3 id="what-operating-system-was-used-on-the-computer">What operating system was used on the computer?</h3>
<p>⏰  <code>09:00</code></p>
<p>I think I need some coffee break&hellip; and breakfast is due as well ☕ 🥐.</p>
<p>⏰  <code>09:30</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back here to carry on my investigation. The data source has <code>Windows</code> and <code>Win98</code> folders and the folder hierachy also indicates that this OS is Windows. <code>4Dell Latitude CPi.e01 -&gt; Listing -&gt; Summary -&gt; Aquisition details -&gt; Acquiry Operating System: Windows XP</code>.</p>
<p>❓ But it&rsquo;s not clear whether this is the OS used to make the image or the OS of the disk itself.</p>
<p>Under <code>Results -&gt; Extracted Content -&gt; Operating System Information</code> there is <code>system</code> entry and there (when I click on it), I get more data (File Metadata and Results are one of them):</p>
<p><img src="images/os-info.png" alt="os-info"></p>
<p>This information appeared only after running <code>Recent Activity</code> Ingest Module (or at least I&rsquo;ve noticed it only then). It indicates <code>Windows_NT</code>. There also is some <code>software</code> entry. I&rsquo;m going to click on it and see its metadata&hellip;</p>
<p>⏰  <code>09:05</code></p>
<p>Well, this one also shows the exact OS - <code>Windows XP</code> (how old is this challenge? 😮). This entry appeared only after running <code>Recent Activity</code> Ingest Module (as is seen on the rightmost bottom corner):</p>
<p><img src="images/os-info2.png" alt="os-info2"></p>
<h3 id="when-was-the-install-date">When was the install date?</h3>
<p>The install date is already known from the previous screenshot (<code>Results -&gt; Extracted Content -&gt; Operation System Information -&gt; Date/Time</code>) and if you believe the Autopsy&rsquo;s analysis is <code>2004-08-19 22:48:27</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🗒 How to extract this information manually? Where is it found in Windows GUI and in registry or other system files?</p>

<p>The registered owner is Greg Schardt. Found right below install date.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-computer-account-name">What is the computer account name?</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s an account name? May be, username? I see several users. Users have ids, and the last digits help to determine what this account is for. Administrator (<code>500</code>) and Guest (<code>501</code>) are default users. Those user accounts added then are given numbers starting from <code>1000</code> at the end and I see 3 users that follow this pattern: <code>HelpAssistant</code>, <code>SUPPORT_blahblah</code> and <code>Mr. Evil</code>.</p>
<p><img src="images/users.png" alt="users"></p>
<p>My guts tell me that the correct answer is <code>Mr.Evil</code>, but I cannot prove it since there are other users listed in SAM as well. And they were created earlier (judging from their IDs).</p>
<p>📆  <code>04/03/2021</code></p>
<p>⏰  ​<code>09:54</code></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the <code>Users</code> folder and check whether there are other users there as well.</p>
<p><img src="images/docs-folder.png" alt="docs-folder"></p>
<p>May be it&rsquo;s this value that they mean: <code>N-1A9ODN6ZXK4LQ	</code>&hellip; . One of the walkthrough articles stated that this is it. But I don&rsquo;t think it is&hellip; . Oh, how hard it is to start&hellip; .</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-primary-domain-name">What is the primary domain name?</h3>
<p>⏰  <code>20:43</code></p>
<p>I have no idea where to look for this. I have not found this thing in the previous locations. I&rsquo;ve found this <a href="https://www.forensicxs.com/computer-forensics-hacking-case-using-autopsy/">resource</a> where the author looks in <code>system</code> registry hive for this information.</p>
<p><img src="images/domain-name.png" alt="domain-name"></p>
<p>I do believe that <code>N-1A9ODN6ZXK4LQ</code> is a domain name since Winlogon states that (screenshot above). I don&rsquo;t know if your trust in Winlogon should be ultimate but I also don&rsquo;t see the point for it to lie 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<h3 id="keyword-lists">Keyword lists</h3>
<p>⏰  <code>10:00</code></p>
<p>A little off the topic. While trying to answer these questions I am also rewatching Autopsy course to recall how to use the tool. Among other interesting things, I&rsquo;ve decided to use <code>Interesting Items</code> Ingest Module. In the case description it says that the attacker is after credit cards 💳. Since I am likely to find them on the system, I am going to create a list of regex-es for credit card numbers from this <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/creditcard.html">link</a> and run the Ingest module again.</p>
<p>I open <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Options</code> -&gt; <code>Keyword Search</code> tab and create a <code>New List</code>. On the right part of the window I press <code>New Keywords</code>, check <code>Regular expression</code> and paste the regex-es from the link. That&rsquo;s what my keyword list looked like in the end:</p>
<p><img src="images/kws-2.png" alt="keyword-lists-cards"></p>
<p>I know that regex is slow, but the disk image is not that big and I am in no hurry.</p>
<p>I also know, that that the owners name is G=r=e=g S=c=h=a=r=d=t (the primary suspect) and that his nickname is Mr.Evil. He is also probably used Starbucks for WiFi sucking. So, I am going to create another Keyword list with this data as well.  That&rsquo;s what my keyword list looked like in the end (Exact much instead of Regex this time):</p>
<p><img src="images/kws-1.png" alt="evil-keyword-list"></p>
<p><img src="images/kws-2.png" alt="evil-keyword-list"></p>
<p>⏰  <code>10:05</code></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not run these keyword lists against my image and see the results. That will give some points to start from. I select my data source <code>Dell Latitude CPi.e01</code>, right click, <code>Run ingest modules</code>, deselect all and select <code>Keyword Search</code> only. I check all lists available including my own newly created and press <code>Finish</code>:</p>
<p><img src="images/keyword-lists.png" alt="keyword-lists"></p>
<p>This is going to take a while so I will pause here and get back in the evening after dinner 🥘  (if I don&rsquo;t feel like a squeezed lemon 🍋). I hopefully won&rsquo;t&hellip; .</p>
