    <p><em><strong>Sunday</strong></em> morning, rain is falling (c) Marron5</p>
<p><em>It was a quite morning and nothing of ill omen was apparent. But as one good Russian saying states, &ldquo;Evil brain - no rest for hands&rdquo;, the closest translation I&rsquo;ve found - &ldquo;No rest for the wicked&rdquo;. So, this was exactly my situation.</em></p>
<p>More than 5 years ago my HDD went belly up (or as another Russian saying states: &ldquo;Commanded to live long&rdquo;). It was a disaster, not all the data was backed up. I tried and tried, but my PC simply wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize the disk. Out of the blue, it just died. My first idea was to repair it to extract at least some data. My collegue (I was not in IT back than) tried to help, but failed. I&rsquo;ve started a research and found a course &ldquo;Repairing HDDs and restoring data from various media&rdquo;. The course title was very promising and I rolled in. It appeared to be usefull, I&rsquo;ve learned the staff I never knew and this also turned my attention to IT field. But it didn&rsquo;t help me with the disk - it was beyond help. I&rsquo;ve postponed this problem for later and then just forgot about this.</p>
<p>Then I met my husband and it was funny to find out that we both had the same make of MacBook. Only that his was a little upgraded (more RAM) and therefore was fast. At some point I&rsquo;ve realized that my device didn&rsquo;t satisfy my needs anymore and had to be replaced. Buying another MacBook sounded too pricy, but my husband&rsquo;s one was there sitting idle (he got a newer model at work). So, I&rsquo;ve been using it for some time. This Macbook had a Bootcamp partition with Windows installed on it. So, there were two OS on one device&hellip; Well, I&rsquo;ve complicated things a bit by installing the third OS as well (Kali Linux), but that&rsquo;s not very relevant to the story. The thing is, after some time I&rsquo;ve decided that I don&rsquo;t need any OS other than MacOS, and I&rsquo;ve decided to get rid of them. Linux went away pretty easily with no long farewells, as if it was waiting for this all this time feeling uncomfortable sitting there and not being able to damage other partitions (as it successfully did several times on Dell). But Windows system just wouldn&rsquo;t go that easily. Having revealed its claws, it got it deep into the system. Having some unused partition that didn&rsquo;t even have an working OS now, was to irritating for me. So, I booted from Live USB (Kali Linux) and opened Gparted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s were the saying becomes self-explanatory (&ldquo;No rest for the wicked&rdquo;). I&rsquo;m not now sure, what I&rsquo;ve done with the disk. Presumably, I&rsquo;ve damaged partition map, but the thing is &hellip;.</p>
<p><img src="images/hmRFH.jpg" alt="hmRFH"></p>
<p>Yeah.. this thing appeared when I tried to boot&hellip; And so it begins.</p>
<p>📆 <code>20/06/2021</code></p>
<p>🕰 <code>11:44 PM</code></p>
<p>💡 Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little bit late. I am rewathing the video about MacBook image examination and an idea suddenly strikes me&hellip; I&rsquo;ve taken a dmg image of the damaged drive. But I have reinstalled the OS already and it works. So, I can image a healthy system now and copy the first N-dozen bytes to my &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; one&hellip; Sort of patching.</p>
