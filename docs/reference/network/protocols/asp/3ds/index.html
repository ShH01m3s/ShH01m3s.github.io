This message is signed. Message id of the PaRes is the same as its corresponding PaReq. This data is zip-base64-url-encoded. You can use the script above to decode and encode this data as well.</p>
<p><strong>MD</strong> is an identifier used by MPI to track transactions. Its format differs with various MPI.  In one of the projects (described in more details in the Blog section) the MPI used a string encrypted with the same algorithm as BrXml.</p>
<p><strong>BrXml</strong>. This one I&rsquo;ve met on the project described in the blog post. However, this value is not mentioned elsewhere throughout the Internet. It is a POST parameter sent twice during a single transaction. This parameter was the main order information source (not PaReq/PaRes). The value of this parameter was presumably encrypted with a block cypher using the same key and\or IV (presumably AES). Having a certain number of requests and observing the changes in BrXml one could spot the offsets at which the data can be changed to manipulate order details. This parameter is malleable which decreases the level of security. Since the integrity of this parameter is not checked, it can be tampered in such a way that one can change payment amount after it was generated by the system.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h3>
<p>Imagine someone is selling fish on the market and someone is there to buy it. A cat is lurking somewhere nearby, ready for a steal. Have you imagined that picture? Just to make it easier for you, here is a Russian meme depicting this situation. It’s hard to translate, since in Russian memes words coming from cats are a little confused on purpose, the declensions and genders are wrong (which is hard to express in English). If a murderer was threatening me with a gun, then I would translate it like that: “Are you sell feshies?” “No, only showing”, “Nicely”.</p>
<p>I know it’s not that great, but still it’s the best illustration I could come up with. So, these cats 🐈 are hackers (obviously). Now, the customer chooses an item and the buyer hands it over to this customer. Suddenly, a cat jumps, gets the fish and runs away. The customer insists that the seller is to give him another fish for free, while the seller says, he is not to blame. The customer’s argument is that these cats are not supposed to be here at all, while the buyer claims he can’t do anything with that and that the customer should have held the fish more tightly. Ojalá there was a way to determine, who’s right and who’s wrong… . No one in this play really cares about the cats 🐈‍⬛ being able to steal the fish 🐠, their main concern is to shift the responsibility for the cat&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>Let’s now draw an imaginary line on the ground that would determine who’s responsibility the security it is. 3D secure is the way to draw this line in the real world.</p>
<p>There are several parties in 3D secure protocol. Yes., it’s a protocol. Like TCP, DHCP, DNS, HTTP or a protocol in case of a fire etc. A protocol is basically a standard that determines the rules of behavior or communication.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Acquirer</strong>. This is the domain of <strong>the merchant</strong> and <strong>his bank</strong> 🏦. In simple words, the party that gets the coin 🪙. Let’s call this party the Witcher 🧙⚔️.</li>
<li><strong>Issuer</strong>. This domain includes <strong>the customer</strong> and <strong>his/her bank</strong> 🏦. Someone who’s paying the Witcher 🧙⚔️. I presume that would be some poor peasant suffering from a monstrous creature lurking behind the barn and stealing staff or even eating the family members.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>. These guys are responsible for all this magic. In the Witcher 🧙⚔️ analogy that would be Jaskier (Dandelion 🌼), I think. He makes sure the coin 🪙 is actually paid. Might not be the best analogy , but I couldn’t come up with anything better. In the real and less exciting world this includes the plugin used by the Merchant (the window where you enter card data and OTP) EXAMPLE, card’s infrastructure (MasterCard, Visa etc) that’s responsible for verification among all things, terminals that use 3D secure etc. In short, everything that is NOT either the issuer’s side or the acquirer’s.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure about the MPI… It might be not really within this domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it’s not all “black and white”. It is far more complicated than that. Sometimes, a bank can be representing all the parties. Pretty much what would happen if the Witcher hired himself to kill a Basilisk because it was destroying his sprouts of cucumbers and cabbages and then paid himself for that. Probably, not with a coin but rather with a fresh and tasty sautéed cabbage 🤢.</p>
<p>And in the real world that would be like if a Bank was offering a web-based internal money transfer (between two accounts in the same bank), using proprietary MPI plugin for that and the cards were not MasterCard or Visa or anything else, but this Bank’s. In this case, EVERYTHING would be the Bank would occupy all the domains: the issuer, the acquirer and even the interoperability domain as well.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see absolutely different scenario: when all the parties are NOT the same entity. There is a bank A (let’s say, Lloyd’s) and a bank B (let’s call it Revolut). Now, there is this guy O’Neill who is the client of Lloyd’s and who has their card 💳 and there is also a music store <em>Violins 🎻 for Dummies</em>, which has a business account in Revolute. O’Neill is learning how to play this beautiful instrument, when it comes to learning, instrument and goes to the store’s website <a href="https://violinsfordummies.co.uk">https://violinsfordummies.co.uk</a>. What we know by now is that O’Neill’s bank, Lloyd’s, is the issuer in this play and both Revolute and the shop are on the acquirer’s side. O’Neill chooses a bow an puts it into the basket. He doesn’t have much money 💴 so that’s pretty much it, so, he presses “Confirm” and proceeds to checkout. Suddenly, O’Neill sees a page where he is supposed to enter his card details. It’s yellowish-black and there is a Unicorn drawn in the corner. He is a little hesitant, he remembers that no one should know card data, but then he also sees “3D Secure” and calms down. He fills in all the data requested by the page and presses Enter. The page now asks for a OTP sent to his phone, which is linked to this card. He enters the OTP and presses Enter. Now, he’s redirected to the shop’s page which says that everything is ok and his bow is on its way.
Oh, it looks like O’Neill has forgotten to buy some coffee ☕️ for tomorrow. He opens his favorite coffee shop <a href="https://coffeeforamateurs.co.uk">https://coffeeforamateurs.co.uk</a> and chooses the bean of his liking, then proceeds to checkout. Wow… He now sees the same 3D Secure page, yellowish-black and with a Unicorn. Does it mean that both of these websites belong to the same entity? No, it doesn’t. Does it mean that both businesses use the same bank? No, it doesn’t. Does it mean that the hackers are having fun? No, it doesn’t! What the hell does it mean then?</p>
<p>It’s easier to think of the page, requesting the card details as a small application. Very primitive-looking web-application whose only job is to display several fields for the client, collect the data entered, send it to the bank and the redirect to whatever URL the bank says it to. I could write such a plugin, decorate it to my taste and sell it for 2 ponds per month to anyone willing to buy it. So, Revolute could have also developed this plugin, and Lloyd’s, and Violins for Dummies, and the Coffee for Amateurs could also code this page. Why doesn’t everyone do it then? Because, in case something goes wrong, he is to blame. It takes money, time and security awareness and technical knowledge to make this plugin properly, so, for small shops like these it’s easier to pay some little money and then think everything is ok.</p>
<p>So, when O’Neill saw the same looking page (MPI, merchant plugin), the main thing he could have deduced is that both sites have bought it from the same company or person.</p>
<p>There is one thing I really need to clarify, I think. Remember, that O’Neill was required to enter OTP (one-time passcode)? He was redirected to this page after submitting his card details. The page he was redirected to with this field to confirm the OTP is NOT the part of the MPI. This page belongs to the bank, that’s why it usually has the same style as other services of this bank. In case of O’Neill this page would bear Lloyd’s style on both websites and on all the other website whenever he uses his Lloyd’s card. OTP is not always required, that is why this step is optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✍️ <em>Now, the protocol is quire confusing because these above are roles and these roles can be played by one single entity. For example, in the project I am talking about, the bank had its own service for money transfer making itself a merchant, they had their own 3D plugin making it partly the interoperability domain. If the person transferring money had his card in this bank as well is the recipient, then this bank was the Issuer and the Acquirer at the same time. So, any mistakes on the way were all the bank’s responsibility.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This decision does make the whole process more secure. Not many companies would like to be responsible for mistakes. So, they prefer to buy this service instead. And dedicated service, especially when provided by the bank, is definitely more secure that something proprietary. That’s just because they must have more experience (do they?).</p>
<p>First, what does 3D Secure mean? No, it has nothing to do with the virtual reality, far from this exciting. The abbreviation stands for “three domain secure”.
Let’s examine the picture above. Light blue server represents the Merchant, his MPI, website and his bank. MPI is sometimes included into Interoperability domain, but not always. For me it makes more sense to place it here, may be I am wrong.</p>
<p>The orange server represents the Interoperability domain which includes payment systems’ networks (MasterCard, Visa, American Express etc). As I’ve mentioned already, this one might include MPI as well.</p>
<p>The purple server represents the Issuer domain which primarily consists of different Issuer’s bank’s servers and systems. On of the main is ACS (Access Control Server). This one will be checking the user identity and processing the messages.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also a client who’s willing to spend his or her coins 🪙, but in this system this person is not taken too much into account.</p>
<p>There are several stages of this protocol. I will start a little earlier and I will flag the step once 3D takes place. Let’s dissect the process of buying a bow by Mr. O’Neill that we have already heard of above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>O’Neill chooses his bow on <a href="https://violinsfordummies.co.uk">https://violinsfordummies.co.uk</a> and puts it into cart 🛒. Since he is not a millionaire (despite working on the weekend), he cannot afford the violin though. He is still saving money for that. For now he will be practicing with just a bow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Creating an Order</p>
<p>He goes to the cart and presses the “Proceed to checkout” button. O’Neill doesn’t notice, but the moment he pressed the button, he was shortly redirected to <a href="https://violinsfordummies.co.uk/createorder">https://violinsfordummies.co.uk/createorder</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is some little magic taking place on the <a href="https://violinsfordummies.co.uk">https://violinsfordummies.co.uk</a> server, and this request is processed. No interaction with O’Neill is made for some time, and this is when the order is created in the <a href="https://violinsfordummies.co.uk">https://violinsfordummies.co.uk</a> website’s database 🗄. These steps are completely invisible for O’Neill and there is no way that he could intercept them unless he managed to exploit the server itself. At his point, O’Neill is just waiting.</p>
<p>The order is created in the database 🗄, but it is yet flagged as unpaid 🏳  for sometime until the Lloyd’s bank confirms that the order was paid. The newly created entry in the DB might look something like that:</p>
<p>Id ItemId ItemName Quantity Price Paid
12 45 Bow the Best 1 🏳️</p>
<p>After the O’Neill’s request was processed and the data saved, the web server generates a unique link for O’Neill.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> 3D Verification</p>
<p>This is where the 3D Secure magic starts taking place. O’Neill to which he is redirected: <a href="https://violinsfordummies.co.uk/mpi">https://violinsfordummies.co.uk/mpi</a>. This the yellowish-black page with a unicorn in the corner. O’Neill fills in the card details. Now he clicks “Confirm”.</p>
<p>Now, there is another magic invisible to neither O’Neill, not to its browser.</p>
<p>MPI contacts the Payment System Directory Server (DS) located in the Interoperability Domain to verify the enrolment of the payment card in 3-D Secure by sending to the DS a Verifying Enrolment Request (VEReq) which includes Cardholder’s payment card number (primary account number (PAN)).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Based on the PAN, the DS finds the card issuer’s Access Control Server (ACS) and contacts it to determine whether the card is enrolled in 3-D Secure.</li>
<li>The ACS responds to the DS, confirming or not confirming that card with the given PAN is enrolled in the payment system.</li>
<li>The DS responds to the MPI with a Verifying Enrolment Response (VERes) message, confirming to the MPI whether the card is enrolled or not. If card is enrolled, the VERes message include the URL of the card issuer’s ACS.</li>
<li>Merchant’s MPI redirects (or provides iFrame) Cardholder browser to the ACS URL adding to POST-request signed Payer Authentication Request (PAReq), which includes PAN and other transaction details.The Cardholder authenticates himself at the ACS authentication.</li>
<li>Depending on supporting authentication method it can be One Time PIN, known fixed password, login to web bank, etc. The personal assurance message (PAM) is chosen by cardholder during the enrolment maybe displayed on this page, if Issuer supports this option.</li>
<li>When Cardholder submitted authentication form as above, the ACS redirects them back to MPI adding a Payer Authentication Response (PARes) message.
The PARes is then forwarded to the MPI via the customer’s browser. PARes includes the transaction status which indicates whether the customer has successfully authenticated with 3-D Secure. Depending on payment system rules and the transaction status in PARes message the merchant can proceed with a payment authorisation request.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>. The client is then redirected to the page where he enters his card details. Using the card number, the card provider and the bank are determined and once it’s found, the request is redirected to the bank. These stages are invisible to the client at all.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>.  Now instead of talking to the website, the client is talking to his bank. The bank has this order number and if the client has enough money 💸 and the card data is correct, it returns a redirect link to the <a href="https://www.trouserswithkittens.com">www.trouserswithkittens.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5</strong>. This redirect link is checked by the seller (the amount, the result of the operation) and if everything is in order, the customer will get his trousers with kittens pretty soon.</li>
