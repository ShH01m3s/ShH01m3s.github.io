<ol>
<li>Coding + security questions (technical)</li>
<li>System design (technical)</li>
<li>Behavioral about my motivation and interests (non-technical)</li>
<li>Behavioral about teamwork.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="behavioral-motivation">Behavioral (Motivation)</h2>

<p>Questions to the interviewer:</p>
<ol>
<li>How big is the team?</li>

<li>Have you given any mentorship?</li>
<li>Have you received any mentorship?</li>
<li>What was the most valuable feedback? (Hoist Locatel, that I don&rsquo;t like my job and want to change it)</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
</ol>
<p>Tell about being very shy and developing communication skills.</p>
<h1 id="behavioural">Behavioural</h1>
<h2 id="questions-from-the-letter">Questions from the letter</h2>
<p><strong>Can you give an example of a valuable piece of feedback that you have received?</strong></p>
<p><strong>HoistLocatel</strong>. Before I entered the IT field, I used to work as an office manager while studying at the university. I didn&rsquo;t have any ideas of what I want to do in future. The job of office manager was rather stressing, I had to keep lots of small tasks in mind and learn to organize them by priority. I even tried automating some portions of work, to get more time for other duties. However some of my collegues thought I am not working well and told this to our vice-president. Our vide-president talked to me in private to see, whether those feedbacks were true. When he realized that I am doing much more that I was asked (like automating things and developing some new office manager&rsquo;s specific processes) he told me that my mistake was that I did it without telling anyone that is why for others it seemed I did nothing. From this feedback I&rsquo;ve come to two valuable conclusions. First, whenever I am doing something new, I should share this with the boss and others because to get a correct evaluation he needs all the information and besides some of my work might be useful for my collegues. Second, I&rsquo;ve realized this career path is not at all what I want to do. I was thinking, why I did those automation stuff without saying and realized I did it because I didn&rsquo;t like doing it. And when I thought further, I&rsquo;ve realized that I was basically trying to automate ALL the work so that I don&rsquo;t have to do it myself. That was the point when I realized that I am not good at such work and that I need to find another job. Then I have accidentally ran into &ldquo;Hacking: the Art of Exploitation&rdquo; book and one thing led to another&hellip; so here I am now.</p>
<p><strong>Describe a time where you had a disagreement or conflict within your team</strong></p>
<p>When I worked in DrWeb (my first infosec job), an idea of organizing a meetup came into my head. It&rsquo;s a shame that in Moscow we, infosecs, don&rsquo;t have meetups like developers. So, I&rsquo;ve decided to lauch a meetup from DrWeb&rsquo;s behalf. I talked to my team lead, I&rsquo;ve discussed it with our PR manager and started preparing. After some time, my team lead said that our head of department (who resides in St. Petersburg) was very offended I wouldn&rsquo;t inform him of this activity. That was a pretty serious situation, since I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to fix it. I messaged him and asked for a video call. He agreed and I had a chance to get things right. We talked and I admited that was my mistake that I didn&rsquo;t keep him informed. I also pointed out that people need motivation and self-development which can be done with the help of a meetup. Besided, that&rsquo;s a useful thing for the company as well. He ageed on that and offered his help in organizing this event. I also managed to get myself a pet project and a ticket to an infosec conference. From that point forward we didn&rsquo;t have any conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>How would your co-workers describe you?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always hard to say what others think, since people at work may not always share their thought directly, but I like to think that others see me as a communicative, friendly person. At least, I always try to get on good terms from the very start, and if I fail, I try at least stay neutral. Besides, I like to share knowledge and when others share knoweldge, I always thank them and let them know that their contribution is being notices and appreciated. Going by the feedback I get from my boss, I am a good worker and I learn deep. I even got a hard project recently, because I&rsquo;ve done so well on my previous project.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe a situation where you had to work with a decision that you didn&rsquo;t agree with?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on mobile application assessment methodology recently. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time diving deep into the subject, I even coded some demo apps for Android to get a better understanding, how certain attacks work. My curator on this project and I had certain disagreements regarding several things. I saw this methodology as a completely internal resource and that&rsquo;s why I thought it should be written informally, so that a new comer who don&rsquo;t know anything about that, wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep over the document. However, my curator disagreed and insisted on having this methodology written as formal as possible. Also, some of the checks are very routine and the comands are the same. It&rsquo;s not very interesting to do it over and over again, so I proposed to write a script for automating this part. My curator thought that was too much and didn&rsquo;t see the problem in doing this work without a script. So, I&rsquo;ve written it myself on the weekend to both ease my job in future, and also to practice my python. Turned out to be very useful for myself.</p>
<p><strong>Describe a technical mistake you have made recently? What did you learn?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a project with a few very serious bugs. I&rsquo;ve spent most of the time getting the most juicy stuff and had only several days for general low-level bugs. Somehow I missed a very simple, actually, quite obvious reflected XSS in a search functionality. Luckily the project architector saw it before we finished the report. I then tried to investgate, where I was wrong, since I remember that I tried XSS payload in different functionality, but Burp doesn&rsquo;t keep the logs consistent by default. Very often it deleted the records and it&rsquo;s hard to reconstruct the chain of events. One of the possible reasons is that I used Chrome for that, and before some recent update it mitigated XSS, so I was supposed to use Firefox. Also, I&rsquo;ve assessed this functionality for many various intersting bugs and then when I&rsquo;ve XSS-ed all possible fields and URLs on other pages, I probably put a check that I&rsquo;ve checked that for XSS as well. Now, I&rsquo;ve installed logging plugin that writes to MySQL Db, I also try to get my own manual logs more consistent, and also in repeater and keep the tabs open for each point of attack and rename them. So that I have some way to check that I&rsquo;ve done all the basics. I tried using Excel for that on my previous projects, but I found it not very comfy.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the most difficult/challenging problem you have had to solve?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say&hellip; Most of the problems seem to be challenging at first and after you get them solved, they don&rsquo;t seem to be so difficult at all. One of my recent projects (one simple visiting card website) was quite challenging. Since it didn&rsquo;t have any interesting functionality (like logging in), no one was expecting that anything interesting will be found. However I&rsquo;ve managed to find two serious bugs (admin page exposed + managed to find auth bypass and they also leaked the login and pass from a third part resource).</p>
<p><strong>If things aren’t going to plan, how do you move yourself/your projects forward?</strong></p>
<p>Well, of course I spend some time in frustration and stressed. But then I try to pull myself together and think how to avoid the damage or if it&rsquo;s not possible, how to minimize it.</p>
<p><strong>How do you seek out opportunities? (we really like candidates who are proactive in fixing/improving things)</strong></p>
<p>I like to learn. I like to share what I&rsquo;ve learnt. I like to stay connected to the people, that I can learn something new from. I also believe in certification. While they don&rsquo;t usually give you any practical knowledge, they systematize the learning process and help building the fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>How do you communicate, both within your team and with other teams?</strong></p>
<p>It highly depends on the reason. If it&rsquo;s some simple question, then I prefer to use some messenger. When it&rsquo;s something official (like, sending a report), I use mail and also (if it&rsquo;s urgent), notificate over a messenger. But when I need to explain something or I need some explanations, I prefer in-person meetings.</p>
<p><strong>What is your biggest failure? What did you learn from this?</strong></p>
<p>Almost two years ago when I was working at DWeb and was in the process of changing a job, I applied to Facebook on some appsec position.</p>
<p><strong>When did you receive constructive feedback? How did you act upon this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your best collaboration experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you do to stay motivated?</strong></p>
<p>To keep myself motivated I usually keep several topics to study and from time to time switch between them. This way I keep my knowledge of these topics approximately evenly distributed and don&rsquo;t loose interest in the field in general. For example, currently I have several main topics that I choose from: memory forensics, MacOS internals and forensics, Windows forensic artifacts. I also let myself dive into other topics from time to time, and change the main ones whenever I feel that I&rsquo;ve reached some acceptable level of knowledge aquired. For example, I used to have mobile application assessment and forensics as one of the topics recently. I now have finished methodology manual at work and preparing a presentation for our customers. That&rsquo;s why this is now not in the list of my main topics.</p>
<p><strong>How do you build relationships?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes quite hard, especially when I am new to the team. That&rsquo;s why I usually meet everyone one by one separately. I introduce myself, I ask the person about his job, about their interests and then tell them about mine. I might even suggest having a coffee break or going to lunch together. Sometimes I start talking with a person I don&rsquo;t know or barely know if we are having lunch at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>What would you do if an interviewer didn’t show up?</strong></p>
<p>I actually had such situation once. I would wait 5-10 minutes, then I would write to the HR manager. I would be online until the HR manager&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p><strong>What is one project you’re proud of?</strong></p>
<p>Several years ago I&rsquo;ve decided to make my own website and post articles and blog posts there about information security as I learn more. At first I used web node and wordpress but it seemed so hard to post there and to make updates. Writing code was even worse. That al ldiscouraged me a bit, I left the website for some time. But then I got a letter on LinkedIn offering a position. Although I was not ready for the new one, I asked for feedback, what was about my profile that caugth their attention. It turned out it was my website. So, I&rsquo;ve realized, that it&rsquo;s getting noticed and it is pretty decent, so I&rsquo;ve decided to take it to another level. I&rsquo;ve googled and tried different options until I&rsquo;ve ran across a Hugo framework. Together with GitPages I managed to make it work. Now I have a very felxible system finely tuned, so I am posting quite often. It has turned out to be even more convenient than having it all in paper.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you want to work for Facebook?</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. I would have taken this job for the sole purpose of relocation.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest compliment you have received in your current role?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to choose between my recent project where I&rsquo;ve been able to get admin and also an access to the third party resource and my mobile application assessment methodology. My boss was very impressed by both.</p>
<p><strong>What would be your biggest challenge coming into this role?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say. With every big change in my life it was always hard to prepare beforehand. The best way to get in was actually getting in. I suppose the biggest challenge would be to get quickly comfortable with the team at first given that there will not meet in person soon. I wonder it Yelp has introduced some way to compensate for the lack of coffee breaks and such for new employyes? Like may be some randomized coffee break over the video?</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about a time that you had a disagreement with your manager.</strong></p>
<p>I have never had serious disagreements with my managers. Sometimes there are some ambiguities about deadlines, but it&rsquo;s only at the start of project and it&rsquo;s settled right away. I can&rsquo;t think of anything other than that. Our project managers are actually making our lives much easier. When I have some questions about the project or accesses or scope, I only ask the manager and they help.</p>
<p><strong>What are Yelp&rsquo;s challenges in the coming years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What would an old co-worker say about you?</strong></p>
<p>I think &ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t left, we would have attended the conference&rdquo;. To be serious, I tried to learn as much as I could and I was trying to motivate my collegues to self-development. I think they even found it arduous. But I hope they saw me as a good worker, quick learner and a friendly teammate.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas to try to convey to the interviewer somehow:</strong></p>
<p>There business people and techies. Each using different vocabulary and terms. It&rsquo;s almost like different languages. In order to support secrity architecture and comply with the standart, we need to try to understand each other.</p>
<h2 id="technical-coding">Technical (coding)</h2>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve screwed up with <code>sorted</code> function which utilises lamda expression, I need to practice with it and with lambdas in general. At the moment I can only generate arrays with lambdas.</p>
<p>Also, finish Udemy Python for Security and solve more challenges on Hackerrank and leetcode (easy and medium).</p>
<h2 id="technical-system-design">Technical (system design)</h2>
<p><a href="/docs/coursenotes/system-design">Here</a> is an article sprecifically for system design interview prep. In general I need to finish these courses to get the idea of this interview, then google common design problem questions, prepare building blocks and review my magical excersice book.</p>
