<p>When reading a person, it&rsquo;s essential to take the other person&rsquo;s emotional state and overal condition to correctly interpret their body language.</p>

<p>Being ‘perceptive’ means being able to spot the contradictions between someone’s words and their body language. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 30). Orion. Kindle Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Cold reading</strong> - &hellip; .</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: I’m glad you’ve come to this session and I can see you have things that are troubling you because I am receiving strong signals from you. I sense that the things you really want out of life sometimes seem unrealistic and you often wonder whether you can achieve them. I also sense that at times you are friendly, social and outgoing to others, but that at other times you are withdrawn, reserved and cautious. You take pride in being an independent thinker but also know not to accept what you see and hear from others, without proof. You like change and variety but become restless if controlled by restrictions and routine. You want to share your innermost feelings with those closest to you but have found it unwise to be too open and revealing. A man in your life with the initial ‘S’ is exerting a strong influence over you right now and a woman who is born in November will contact you in the next month with an exciting offer. While you appear disciplined and controlled on the outside, you tend to be concerned and worried on the inside and at times you wonder whether or not you have made the right choice or decision.

<li>Women are better at both spotting and hiding lies.</li>
<li>Most men and women don&rsquo;t know what they look like from the neck down.</li>
<li>When negotiating over the phone, the person with the stronger argument wins, while when negotiating face to face, the one who&rsquo;s better with body language wins.</li>
<li>Man who is self-conscious about gaining weight may tug at the fold of skin under his chin; the woman who is aware of extra pounds on her thighs may smooth her dress down; the person who is feeling fearful or defensive might fold their arms or cross their legs or both; and a man talking with a large-breasted woman may consciously avoid staring at her breasts while, at the same time, unconsciously use groping gestures with his hands. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 27). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>Each time he mentioned politicians’ incomes, he held his hands a yard (1m) apart. However, when he mentioned executive salaries, he held them only a foot (30cm) apart. His hand distances revealed that he felt politicians were getting a much better deal than he was prepared to admit. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 28). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>Women have between fourteen and sixteen areas of the brain to evaluate others’ behaviour versus a man’s four to six areas. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 30). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>Seven out of ten people cross their left arm over their right. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 34). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>For example, most men put on a coat right arm first; most women put it on left arm. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 34). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>When a man passes a woman in a crowded street, he usually turns his body towards her as he passes; she instinctively turns her body away from him to protect her breasts. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 35). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>Nodding the head is almost universally used to indicate ‘yes’ or affirmation. It appears to be a form of head lowering and is probably an inborn gesture because it’s also used by people born blind. When a baby has had enough milk, it turns its head from side to side to reject its mother’s breast. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 35). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>When a person’s words and body language are in conflict, women ignore what is said. Pease, Allan; Pease, Barbara. The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to read others&rsquo; attitudes by their gestures (p. 40). Orion. Kindle Edition.</li>
<li>Sigmund Freud once reported that while a patient was verbally expressing happiness with her marriage, she was unconsciously slipping her wedding ring on and off her finger.</li>
<li>Similarly, artists, musicians, surgeons and those whose occupation is delicate and involves use of their hands generally prefer not to shake hands, but, if they are forced into it, they may use a ‘dead fish’ handshake to protect their hands.</li>
<li>For example, obese people can’t cross their legs. Women who wear short skirts will sit with their legs tightly crossed for protection, but this results in them looking less approachable and less likely to be asked to dance at a nightclub.</li>
<li>Older people are harder to read than younger ones because they have less muscle tone in the face.</li>
<li>Signals like pupil dilation, sweating and blushing cannot be consciously faked but exposing the palms to try to appear honest is easily learned.</li>
<li>When men lie their body language can be obvious. Women prefer to look busy as they lie. Keeping their hands in their pockets is a favourite ploy of men who don’t want to participate in a conversation.</li>
<li>The palms have more sweat glands than any other part of the body.</li>
<li>Bob didn’t understand the negative significance of the tight-lipped, no-teeth-visible female smile.</li>
<li>The orbicularis oculi at the eyes act independently and reveal the true feelings of a genuine smile.</li>
<li>The remarkable thing about a smile is that when you give it to someone, it causes them to reciprocate by returning the smile, even when you are both using fake smiles.</li>
<li>Professor Ruth Campbell, from University College London, believes there is a ‘mirror neuron’ in the brain that triggers the part responsible for the recognition of faces and expressions and causes an instant mirroring reaction. In other words, whether we realise it or not, we automatically copy the facial expressions we see.</li>
<li>Not only can it do that, but the brain can separate the smile from every other part of the face.</li>
<li>Research by Paul Ekman showed that when people deliberately lie, most, especially men, smile less than they usually do. A liar’s smile comes more quickly than a genuine smile and is held much longer, almost as if the liar is wearing a mask. A false smile often appears stronger on one side of the face than the other, as both sides of the brain attempt to make it appear genuine. genuine. The half of the brain’s cortex that specialises in facial expressions is in the right hemisphere and sends signals mainly to the left side of the body. As a result, false facial emotions are more pronounced on the left side of the face than the right. People who were innocent and telling the truth increased their smiling frequency when being honest.</li>
<li>The older we become, the more serious we become about life. An adult laughs an average of 15 times a day; a preschooler laughs an average of 400 times.</li>
<li>laughter. Chimps can have linguistic concepts, but they can’t physically make the sounds of language. Because we walk upright, humans have a huge range of freedom in the sounds we make, including speech and laughter. People who have trouble with laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin-induced laughter produces. Alcohol loosens inhibitions and lets people laugh more, which releases endorphins. This is why most well-adjusted people laugh more when they drink alcohol, while unhappy people become even more despondent or even violent. Paul Ekman found that one of the reasons we are attracted to smiling and laughing faces is because they can actually affect our autonomic nervous system. We smile when we see a smiling face and this releases endorphins into our system. If you are surrounded by miserable, unhappy people you are also likely to mirror their expressions and become morose or depressed.</li>
<li>Even though we consciously know that the joke is not a real event, our laugh releases endorphins for self-anaesthesis as if the joke was a real event. If it was a real event, we may go into crying mode and the body would also release its endorphins. Crying is often an extension of a laughing bout and is why, in a serious emotional crisis, such as hearing about a death, a person who cannot mentally accept the death may begin laughing. When the reality hits, the laughter turns to crying.</li>
<li>Robert Provine found that laughing was more than 30 times as likely to occur in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. Only 15% of our laughter has to do with jokes. Laughter has more to do with bonding.</li>
<li>Research by Marvin Hecht and Marianne La France from Boston University has revealed how subordinate people smile more in the presence of dominant and superior people, in both friendly and unfriendly situations, whereas superior people will smile only around subordinate people in friendly situations. Pictures of unsmiling women were decoded as a sign of unhappiness while pictures of unsmiling men were seen as a sign of dominance. From a man’s perspective, saying that a woman has a good sense of humour doesn’t mean she tells jokes; it means she laughs at his jokes.</li>
<li>Remember that with all body language, the meaning of the message is also in the receiver, as well as the sender.</li>
<li>Men’s arms rotate slightly inwards while women’s arms rotate slightly outwards.</li>

<h2 id="finger-gestures">Finger Gestures</h2>
<h2 id="hands">Hands</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open palms - honesty (might be used intentionally even when lying). Trying to conceal hands in the pockets or behind one&rsquo;s back might be a signal of an opposite intention. Most people find it difficult to lie with their palms exposed because of the law of cause and effect.</li>
<li>Palms
<ol>
<li>Facing up.</li>
<li>Facing down.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Handshakes
<ol>
<li>Salespeople are taught that if they initiate a handshake with a customer on whom they call unannounced or uninvited, it can produce a negative result as the buyer may not want to welcome them and feels forced to shake hands.</li>
<li>Women who initiate a firm handshake are rated – in most places – as more open-minded and make better first impressions. She simply needs to avoid signals of femaleness such as soft handshakes, short skirts and high heels if she wants equal credibility.</li>
<li>The palm needs to warm and dry. Alternatively, before a new meeting, simply visualise that you are holding your palms in front of an open fire. This visualisation technique is proven to raise the temperature of the average person’s palm by 3–4 degrees.</li>
<li><strong>Create Equaty</strong>. For the handshake of equals, you need to make sure your hands are in the vertical position. Also, apply the same amount of pressure that you are receiving.</li>
<li><strong>Disarming</strong>.
<ol>
<li>Step-to-the-right technique. Make a step forward with your left leg. Step with the right leg moving in front of the person and in the person&rsquo;s personal space. Then move the left leg to the right one and shake the hand.</li>
<li>Hand-on-top technique. Put your left hand over his hand, forming a Double-Hander. On the other hand, the Double-Hander is like a miniature hug and is acceptable only in circumstances where a hug could also be acceptable. two-handed handshake is to try to show sincerity, trust or depth of feeling for the receiver. Two significant elements should be noticed. Firstly, the left hand is used to communicate the depth of feeling the initiator wants to convey and this is relative to the distance the initiator’s left hand is placed up the receiver’s right arm. Secondly, the initiator’s left hand is an invasion of the receiver’s personal space. In general, the Wrist Hold and the Elbow Grasp are acceptable only where one person feels close to the other and in these cases the initiator’s left hand enters only the outer edge of the receiver’s personal space.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Bad hanshakes.
<ol>
<li>Wet fish (cold and wet)</li>
<li>The vice. Sometimes it will be used by a person who feels weak and fears they will be dominated by others. Dominant position, strong grasp, too strong. A couple of strokes.</li>
<li>Bone crusher. The Bone-Crusher is the trademark of the overly aggressive personality who, without warning, seizes the early advantage and attempts to demoralise his opponent by grinding his knuckles to a smooth paste.</li>
<li>Finger-tip grab. Even though the initiator may seem to have an enthusiastic attitude towards the receiver, he in fact lacks confidence in himself. The Finger-Tip Grab can also result from personal space differences between the people in the handshake.</li>
<li>Stiff-arm thrust. the Stiff-Arm Thrust tends to be used by aggressive types and its main purpose is to keep you at a distance and away from their personal space. It’s also used by people raised in rural areas, who have larger personal space needs and want to protect their territory.</li>
<li>The socket-wrencher. A popular choice of power players and common cause of watering eyes and, in extreme cases, torn ligaments. first, the initiator is an insecure type who feels safe only within his own personal space; second, the initiator is from a culture that has smaller space needs; or third, he wants to control you by pulling you off balance.</li>
<li>The pump Handle. series of rapid vertical strokes. Occasionally, the pumper will cease pumping but continue to hold the receiver’s hand to prevent their escape and, interestingly, few people try to pull their hand away. The act of being physically connected seems to weaken our resolve to retreat.</li>
<li>The Dutch treat. It’s a distant relative of the Wet Fish but stiffer and less clammy to the touch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="smiles">Smiles</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tight-lipped. It sends the message that the smiler has a secret or a withheld opinion or attitude that they will not be sharing with you. It’s a favourite of women who don’t want to reveal that they don’t like someone and is usually clearly read by other women as a rejection signal.</li>
<li>Twisted. The Twisted Smile is peculiar to the Western world and can only be done deliberately which means it can send only one message – sarcasm.</li>
<li>Drop-jaw. Practised smile.</li>
<li>Sideways-Looking-Up Smile. With the head turned down and away while looking up with a Tight-Lipped Smile, the smiler looks juvenile, playful and secretive. This coy smile has been shown to be men’s favourite everywhere, because when a woman does it, it engenders parental male feelings, making men want to protect and care for females.</li>
<li>The George W Bush Grin. Bush is a Texan and they smile more than most other Americans.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="arms">Arms</h2>
<ol>
<li>By folding one or both arms across the chest, a barrier is formed that is an unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstances. take an arms-folded position when they disagree with what they’re hearing.</li>
<li>Holding the hands over the crotch makes men feel more secure when they feel threatened.</li>
<li>women tend to keep their arms more open when they are around men they find attractive and are likely to fold their arms across their breasts around aggressive or unattractive men.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforced Arm-Crossing</strong>. If a person has clenched fists as well as a full arm-cross, this cluster, called Fists-Clenched-Arm-Crossed, shows hostility as well as defensiveness. If it’s combined with a tight-lipped smile or clenched teeth and red face, a verbal or even physical attack could happen.</li>
<li><strong>Arm Gripping</strong>. The Double-Arm-Grip is characterised by the person’s hands tightly gripping their upper arms to reinforce themselves and avoid exposure of the front of the body. Self-hugging. It shows a negative, restrained attitude.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="children">Children</h2>
<ol>
<li>If a five-year-old child tells a lie, he’s likely to immediately cover his mouth with one or both hands.  When a teenager tells a lie, the hand is brought to the mouth in a similar way to the five-year-old, but instead of the obvious hand-slapping gesture over the mouth, the fingers rub lightly around it. -&gt; When an adult tells a lie, it’s as if his brain instructs his hand to cover his mouth in an attempt to block the deceitful words, just as it did for the five-year-old and the teenager. But, at the last moment, the hand is pulled away from the face and a nose touch gesture results.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="poses">Poses</h2>
<p>Standing on the left side of a photo shows power, because from this position the handshakes are usually dominating.</p>
<h3 id="submissive">Submissive</h3>
<ol>
<li>Shoulder Shrug</li>
<li>The palm facing up is used as a submissive, non-threatening gesture</li>
<li>Smiling. Babies quickly learn that crying gets our attention – and that smiling keeps us there.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="authoritative">Authoritative</h3>
<ol>
<li>Critical Evaluation
<ol>
<li>Thumb supports the chin</li>
<li>Index finger pointing up</li>
<li>Finger covers the mouth</li>
<li>Crossed legs/arms</li>
<li>Head and chin down (negative/hostile)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Palm down</li>
<li>Palm-Closed-Finger-Pointed is a fist where the pointed finger is used like a symbolic club.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="culture-specific">Culture specific</h2>
<ol>
<li>In some countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines, finger pointing at a person is an insult as this gesture is only used to point at animals. Malaysians will use their thumb to point to people or to give directions.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lecturing-tips">Lecturing tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open hands. No crossing of arms. No pointing fingers or palm-down positions.</li>
<li>When you see someone take the arms-crossed position, it’s reasonable to assume that you may have said something with which they disagree. It may be pointless continuing your line of argument even though the person could be verbally agreeing with you. The fact is that body language is more honest than words. A simple but effective way of breaking the arms-folded position is to give the listener something to hold or give them something to do.  Giving them a pen, book, brochure, sample or written test forces them to unfold their arms and lean forward. This moves them into a more open position and, therefore, a more open attitude. Asking someone to lean forward to look at a visual presentation can also be an effective means of opening the arms-folded position. You could also lean forward with your palms up and say, ‘I can see you have a question…what would you like to know?’ or, ‘What’s your opinion?’ You then sit or lean back to indicate that it’s their turn to speak. By using your palms you non-verbally tell them.</li>
