<p>In short, understand your scope (technical and legal aspects), your goals and people you are going to work with. Identify the stakeholders. Decide on the tools.</p>
<h3 id="toolkit-assembly">Toolkit Assembly</h3>
<ul>
<li>A PC technician&rsquo;s toolkit 🧰 (screwdrivers 🪛, squeezers, scissors✂️ , portable batteries 🔋and etc) to be able to remove HDD, lockdown cables etc) ✅.</li>
<li>Digital camera 📸  that embed timestamps on the photos. 📝 Take photos, the more the better!</li>
<li>Video camera 📹. 📝 Take a video, the longer the better.</li>
<li>For labeling and documenting (labels, markers, pens, 🖊, evidence tape 🚧).</li>
<li>Transporting and managing evidence 💼 (Faraday bag , Anti-static bag, evidence log, large envelopes ✉️,  gloves🧤, sanitizer, ).</li>

<p><strong>Choose the appropriate media.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❓ What&rsquo;s the file system and OS of the target media? Depending on the answer you might need to appropriately format the evidence drive and assemple a flash drive with the tools needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>: FAT12, 32, 64, NTFS, ReFS.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong>: EXT 2,3,4, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS, Btrfs.</p>
<p><strong>MacOS</strong>: APFS, HFS+, Offers a novel technique to acquire disk copies using a firewire cable between two PCs: Target Disk Mode. Press F (?).</p>
<p><strong>Choose the acquision method.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❓ Will there only be live or dead acquisition?</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❓ Will you make a <strong>logical backup</strong> (doesn&rsquo;t copy all i.e. doesn&rsquo;t copy slack, free space and deleted files) or <strong>imaging</strong> (bit-by-bit copy). ⚠️ Should not be used on a live system!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="define-investigation-type">Define Investigation Type</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ It&rsquo;s a very important thing to note in case of IP (intellectual property cases). Ensure, that data and devices of the suspect are IMMEDIATLY preserved and not accessed by anyone. I guess that&rsquo;s because of the timestamps.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>❓ <em>What is the case about?</em></li>
<li>❓ <em>What evidence do we expect to recover?</em></li>
<li>❓ <em>Where is the evidence most likely located?</em></li>
<li>❓ <em>What are the legal restrictions?</em></li>
<li>❓ <em>Who is involved and what&rsquo;s their role?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Develop a plan to collect the data. Each type of data will require separate plan. This plan should prioritise the sources and the order. For example, if you are dealing with a system that is turned on, first, take photos of the screen, then collect the volatile data (RAM) and them make a copy of a hard drive. Then turn it off and send to the lab in a safety bag. Maintain chain of custody.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🗒 For several different case make a checklist</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sterilizing-target-media">Sterilizing Target Media</h3>
<p>Before copying evidence or making a disk image one needs to sterelize the target media to make sure that data that was present on that disk prior to this operation would not medle with the evidence data. Several rounds of writing <code>0</code>s is usually enough. Keep in mind that flash drives work in different manner and that&rsquo;s why simple permanent deletion of a file deems to be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>On Windows you can use a <code>KillDisk</code> utility to <em>erase</em> it (not wipe, since wipe clears the unused space only). To verify that the disk was indeed sterilized, run <code>Checksums -&gt; Checksum 64</code> in <code>HxD</code> hex editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>😡 Once again, whenever I am trying to follow some instructions from the courses or books, there is something that goes wrong. This time is no exception. On trying to open the erased disk <code>HxD</code> alerts &ldquo;Insufficient rights even for administator&rdquo;. What that hell 😡? If I partition the drive, it becomes accessible, but then it&rsquo;s not WIPED!</p>
<p>✍️ Looks like either the drive was very old (and it was) or it doesn&rsquo;t work on partitions (logical drives). I&rsquo;ve used a newer drive, and I erased the whole disk, without making any partitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="collection">Collection</h2>
<p>Begins with first response and arriving to the scene. Opponents will try to discredit your work. Use industry accepted tools. Know the digital footprint of these tools. Document everything. Before anything can be acquired, it needs to be properly documented first. Everything must be recorded and documented <strong>❗️First</strong> responders <strong>first</strong> arrive on the scene (how weird&hellip;.). Not always they are digital forensic experts.</p>
<h3 id="documenting">Documenting</h3>
<p>Start documenting even before you get to the scene.</p>

<h3 id="take-photos-and-videos">Take photos and videos</h3>
<p>First, make sure that timestamps are configured on both devices. Take as many photos and videos as possible. Take overall and close-up photos. Make sure that all the connections between the devices are photographed clearly. Photograph the evidence in situ (if possible).</p>
<p>Below is the checklist for the first Responder to make sure they&rsquo;ve done everything needed before leaving the scene:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓All photos taken before touching the scene?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Chain of custody properly carried out?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Remove evidence drive from the PC</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Sanitize the target disk</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Is all the write blocker to be used verified prior to this investigation?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Is the imaging software verified according to the policy or at least once a month? (the whole drive is imaged)?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Connect the write blocker to the PC and the evidence drive to the write blocker (power + data cables)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Is the WB option on?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Calculate <strong>the hash of the evidence drive</strong> (pre-hash). Document it.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Image the evidence.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Calculate the <strong>hash of the original evidence</strong> again, validate the hash and document it.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❗️Calculate the <strong>hash of the image that was taken</strong> (post-hash) and make sure it matches the above ones taken previously.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identify-the-evidence">Identify the evidence</h3>
<p>Assign IDs for each evidence. For example, for a flash drive it would look like this. FD (flash drive) + its <em>sequence number</em> within this case + case number. Subsequent images of these devices will have the same number + copy&rsquo;s sequence number.</p>
<p>Example: <em>A USB Flash drive was found on the scene during case study 0124. It was the first USB drive found yet. This device was assigned a number FD-01-0124. Then we made two bit-by-bit copies of this drive and these were assigned numbers FD-01-0124-01 and FD-01-0124-02 respectively.</em></p>
<h3 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t contaminate the scene (try not to be tempted to eat buiscuits 🍪 and burgers 🍔 on the scene, however hard that might seem). This means, that you should also preserve the physical evidence as well. Don&rsquo;t touch ANYTHING before the lead investigator says &ldquo;OK&rdquo; 👍. Always mind the scope and get it in writing even if it&rsquo;s not a crimial case. Do fingerprints need to be collected? DNA?</p>
<p>What types of evidence can I come across?</p>
<ul>
<li>Obvious - PC, cameras, flash drives, PDAs, removable media. Mind the chain of custody. Document the physical condition (mouse to left or right as the owner is a lefty or a righty), applications running, keep audio notes.</li>
<li>Non-obvious
<ul>
<li>manuals for devices that were not found - look for these devices</li>
<li>digital media taken with some device that was not found -look for this device</li>
<li>Sticky notes or liitle papers with scrambled notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to consider when acquiring a PC is wether it&rsquo;s turned on or off?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Then transport it as is. Do not forget the charger!</li>
<li>No. Depending on the case nature, turn off or perform the RAM capture.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hddssd-imaging">HDD/SSD Imaging</h4>
<p>You may perform either live or dead acquisition.</p>
<p>For dead acquisition follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the target media (evidence drive) is sterilised (ref. Identification/Assessment stage above).</li>
<li>Turn the machine off (better unplugging it to prevent data from being overwritten).</li>
<li>Attach the write-blocker and the evidence drive.</li>
</ol>
<p>For live acquisition follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attach a write blocker or run a software-based one.</p>
<p>On the forensic Macbook you can turn off disk arbitration or use write blockers. To turn off this feature refer to <a href="https://forensicswiki.xyz/wiki/index.php?title=Disabling_Macintosh_Disk_Arbitration_Daemon">this</a> page. It&rsquo;s needed so that the forensic machine won&rsquo;t make changes to the data on the suspect Macbook. For Mac acquisition - follow <a href="https://forensicswiki.xyz/wiki/index.php?title=Acquiring_a_MacOS_System_with_Target_Disk_Mode">these</a> steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🧪 <em>What files are changed when something is connected to a Mac (USB or using Thunderbolt)? Is turning off the disk arbitration feature really prevents the changed being made to the target drive?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="preservation">Preservation</h3>
<p>Package the evidence for transport. Transport the evidence. Store the evidence while in possession. Use Faraday bags for avoiding remote tampering, anti-static and plastic bags as a protection from discharge and moisture. Tape and seal the bags with the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Preservation</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/exchange-principle#:~:text=Locard's%20Exchange%20Principle%20states%20that,pollen%2C%20paint%2C%20and%20soil.">Locard&rsquo;s Exchange Principle</a>. To keep the evidence safe and admissable in court, document everything. When acquiring data from memory, use write blockers (soft- or hardware-based). If the device is off, don&rsquo;t turn it on. If it&rsquo;s on - take photos 📸 of all windows, note running applications and processes (mind destructive processes and encryption 🔐). If you see a destructive process running, pull the plug from the PC (not the wall), take out the battery or shut it down immediatly. You need to be able to identify at least some of disk-wiping software. However, some of them might be command line and get triggered when USB is plugged in (<a href="/docs/dfir/antiforensics/usbkill-switch">kill switch</a>).</p>

<p>To avoid remote wiping or evidence tampering - RF shielding (Faraday bag).</p>
<p>To prevent battery loss (in case we need the device to be on), keep the device connected to the power supply (for example, portable). ⚠️ Turning off might trigger encryption!</p>
<p>Document the changes that you are making. Know your tools 🛠! What changes they are making (<a href="https://peat-chameleon-e41.notion.site/bf3cb04f2a074cfc816f853cec92d783?v=f8cbcf21bcb641b6806fb22decfccf9f">see</a>).</p>

<p>Do not make assumptions before testing! For example, a QuizUp game folder contained some usernames and pictures and the assumption would be that this person was in touch with the suspect. However, testing revealed that when you choose to randomly find you a rival from around the globe 🌎, QuizUp automatically adds them to the player&rsquo;s contacts.</p>
<p>Jessica advices to use appropriate view-managers for specific files, but I would also recommend to check these files in hex as well. There was once a case when I performed vulnerability assessment of a mobile application and I got a SQLite DB, opened it in SQLite Browser DB and couldn&rsquo;t find the data I was looking for. However <code>grep</code>  command showed that this data <em>was</em> in the DB. I opened it in hex and noticed that it might have been damaged because there was an amount of data almoust the same size as the visible one, that was not shown in the viewer. Perhaps that were some deleted rows or the DB <em>was</em> damaged indeed.</p>
<p>Applications of different versions or platforms may have different data structure. For example, iOS QuizUp had a geolocation field, while Android didn&rsquo;t at that point in time.	[<a href="https://www.eccu.edu/methodology-for-testing-forensic-hypothesis-and-finding-truth/#attend">1</a>]</p>

<p>Art supersedes science. Know what is garbage. Unexpected places. Don&rsquo;t ignore exculpatory (proving innocence) data.</p>
<p>Bypassing controls (if, say, it&rsquo;s PIN protected, data encrypted, ACL, compression). There will be lots of data and only some is relevant. In most cases, NSRL file data is used to eliminate known files, such as operating system and application files, during criminal forensic investigations. This reduces the number of files which must be manually examined and thus increases the efficiency of the investigation.

<p>Mind that APFS <a href="/docs/articles/forensics/analysis/11-apple/mac-artifacts">timestamps</a> and NTFS <a href="/docs/articles/forensics/analysis/13-windows/win-artifacts">timestamps</a> are different! With NTFS when you add a file to the system (for example, copy it from USB drive), the MAC times are changed. However, on APFS <em>Added</em> attribute is added, providing you with slightly more information.</p>

<li>hashes</li>
<li>write-blocking devices</li>
<li>min files created</li>
<li>register timestamps before openning files</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Correlation</strong></p>
<p>Correlate data with other independent sources. Some data might have been tampered with and you should try to find other evidence that describe the same data. For example, timestamps can be easily changed. Therefore, try to find network or login events to correlate them.</p>
<p><strong>Logging</strong></p>
<p>Always log and document all you do. This might be important in court. It&rsquo;s especially important when analysing live systems.</p>

<p>There are different paths to follow to answer the same questions. Some are more efficitent.</p>
<p>Pulling on threads.  Find a piece of evidence and focus on that to fully understand it. Example (depth search):</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for malware and find program run entry for malware</li>
<li>Stop looking for other malware and focus on that one
<ul>
<li>What happened before and after?</li>
<li>What else is in the same folder?</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat for each you find</li>
</ul>
<p>How to find the first evidence? Prioritize or brute force.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritize</strong> (Manual). You never know where the evidence are going to be.
<ul>
<li>impact on investigation result</li>
<li>likelyhood to find anything</li>

<p>This is also a crucial part to share the findings, IOCs and info about threat actors with the threat hunting team 🔪 .</p>
<p>The final report should contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>case summary (who requested, who&rsquo;s in charge, principles involved, when did the incident occur, when was this report filed, what allegedly happened, copies of all legal authorizations to proceed);</li>
<li>Authorizations (original request in writing, warrants, subpoenas, written permissions);</li>
<li>procedural docs (inventory of items examined and chain of custody for each, tools used, timeline of procedures, list of people performing these procedures, hashed before and after);</li>
<li>case notes (all logs extracted from the target system and from the forensic tools, a diagram of network where investigation occurred (sometimes));</li>
<li>what physical evidence were collected (videos, pics, copies of docs, interview transcripts);</li>
<li>conclusion (ties all together, supports or refuses the original claim, does NOT prove guilt/innocence).</li>
</ul>
<p>Make electronic copies of the report. An archive copy is maintained by the team. DVDs for distribution. Copies of written docs are filed. A summary report is provided along with timelines and written + electronic docs.</p>

<h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge assumptions</strong> (sometimes its something you have not seen or dealt with before), consider alternatives, evaluate data, identify key drivers, understand context.</p>
<p>List all assumptions and ask yourself how sure you are of these statements and what might happen if they are wrong. Categorize these assumptions based on the certainty. Refine and remove those assumptions that are proven to be wrong. Identify addition data needs for those assumptions that are still uncertain. Research?</p>
<p>Think about the <strong>alternatives</strong>, for example, brainstorming. Ask yourself the six W&rsquo;s to help develop the alternatives. Null hypothesis - the opposite to the main hypothesis (for anomalous data).</p>
<p>Know your data! <strong>Know normal and abnormal</strong>. Establish the baselines for normal to be able to detect the abnormal (like, a clean installation of a system is examined and everything is then compared to it). Look for incosistent data. <strong>Assess the data against different hypothesis</strong> to see how well it fits.</p>
<p>Identify key drivers: technology, regulatory (laws and standards), society (politics, people want to be safe), supply chain (logistics, cost, scheduling, customer requirements), employees (skills and training needed), threat actors (tech capabilities, motives, opportunity).</p>
<p>Understand the context from the perspective of different stakeholders. Framing techniques help keep everyone on the same page (what do they need from me, how can I frame the issue, do I need to place their questions in a broader context). Same vocabulary. Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key components. Break the problem down and identify the partss, actors and categories.</li>
<li>Factors at Play.</li>
<li>Relationships. Static? Dynamic? Graphing.</li>
<li>Similarities/Differences. Leverage the past work!</li>
<li>Redefine. Rephrase and paraphrase the issue. What is the root cause?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all the files are worth considering. However, it&rsquo;s hard to keep all of them in mind.
