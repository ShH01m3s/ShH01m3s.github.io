<li>A PC technician&rsquo;s toolkit 🧰 (screwdrivers 🪛, squeezers, scissors✂️ , portable batteries 🔋and etc) to be able to remove HDD, lockdown cables etc) ✅.</li>
<li>Digital camera 📸  that embed timestamps on the photos. 📝 Take photos, the more the better!</li>
<li>Video camera 📹. 📝 Take a video, the longer the better.</li>
<li>For labeling and documenting (labels, markers, pens, 🖊, evidence tape 🚧).</li>
<li>Transporting and managing evidence 💼 (Faraday bag , Anti-static bag, evidence log, large envelopes ✉️,  gloves🧤, sanitizer, ).</li>
<li>Documents (chain of custody, notes 🗒, warrants/subpoenas).</li>
<li>Digital forensics specifics (forensics software, write blockers, laptop 💻, sterilize target media, flash drives for live/dead acquisition, bootable).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>Before any data from the suspect drive or RAM can be copied to the forensic device, this device needs to be prepared. First choose the way that the evidence will be acquired. There are several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>live 🌳
<ul>
<li><strong>remote.</strong>  🛠 F-Response can be used to acquire the evidence this way. Mind that it needs a client to be installed on the suspect machine. Besides, its footprint can be rather notable. Also, CyberTriage can be used for remote live-analysis.</li>
<li><strong>local</strong>. For this type of acquisition it&rsquo;s better to have a thumb drive with two partitions: one for the tools (smaller one) and the other is the partition for suspect data. I have a 64Gb USB drive with a 15Gb allocated for tools (windows, macos and linux), and the rest of space - for data. Of course, in the wild this won&rsquo;t be enough space, but for learning purposes it&rsquo;s quite enough. The tools partition is formated with FAT32 (since all the files are quite small) and the memdump partition is formated with exFAT. Both FAT32 and exFAT are cross platform. The latter is designed for large files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>dead ☠️
<ul>
<li><strong>remote.</strong> F-Response can also be used for this.</li>
<li><strong>local.</strong> Several options available
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloning</strong>. Bit-by-bit copy on another drive. Can even boot from it. Will include MBR or GPT of the physical drive.</li>
<li><strong>Copy</strong>. Only files and their slack space is copied.</li>
<li><strong>Imaging</strong>. Bit-by-bit copy, but stored as a file. The image can be compressed to save space and store data on a smaller disk. If the volume is imaged, MBR/GPT are not copied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dd</code>. No compression. Also, <code>img</code> and ???. Just an image. Some tools provide with a separate file with some additional information, but the image file itself has no built-in information. 🛠 <code>dd</code>, <code>dcfldd</code>, <code>dc3dd</code> (command line tools) and FTK Imager (GUI tool).</li>
<li><code>E01</code>. Compressed. A CRC is calculated every 64Kb of data. Also has a header and a footer with metadata of the image and target machine. 🛠 FTK Imager can produce this format and Autopsy - analyse (if you&rsquo;re looking for freeware). EnCase is the owner of this format.</li>
<li><code>AFF</code>. Compressed.</li>
<li><code>Smart</code>. Compressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>⚠️ Anyway, the drive that will contain the evidence should be zerod first. Tools 🛠 to use for this are, for example, <a href="https://www.killdisk.com/eraser.html">Active@Kill Disk</a> and <a href="https://eraser.heidi.ie/">Eraiser</a>. Check that the target disk is all <code>0</code>s. For that use <code>HxD</code> or <code>010 Editor</code> (?) and run a checksum 64 against it. It should be all zeros. Before copying evidence or making a disk image one needs to sterelize the target media to make sure that data that was present on that disk prior to this operation would not medle with the evidence data. Several rounds of writing <code>0</code>s is usually enough. Keep in mind that flash drives work in different manner and that&rsquo;s why simple permanent deletion of a file deems to be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>On Windows you can use a <code>KillDisk</code> utility to <em>erase</em> it (not wipe, since wipe clears the unused space only). To verify that the disk was indeed sterilized, run <code>Checksums -&gt; Checksum 64</code> in <code>HxD</code> hex editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>😡 Once again, whenever I am trying to follow some instructions from the courses or books, there is something that goes wrong. This time is no exception. On trying to open the erased disk <code>HxD</code> alerts &ldquo;Insufficient rights even for administator&rdquo;. What that hell 😡? If I partition the drive, it becomes accessible, but then it&rsquo;s not WIPED!</p>
<p>✍️ Looks like either the drive was very old (and it was) or it doesn&rsquo;t work on partitions (logical drives). I&rsquo;ve used a newer drive, and I erased the whole disk, without making any partitions. Another option is to note the starting sector and size in sectors, open the physical drive in <code>HxD</code>, select the sectors that were wiped and calculate checksum for the selection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="validating-the-tools">Validating the tools</h2>
<p><strong>Validate Sanitisation</strong></p>
<p>Check that the target disk is all <code>0</code>s. For that use <code>HxD</code> or <code>010 Editor</code> (?) and run a checksum 64 against it. It should be all zeroes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚫 When trying to open a partition without a valid file system on it, I run on this error: Insufficient rights even as an administator.</p>
<p>✍️ Looks like either the drive was very old (and it was) or it doesn&rsquo;t work on partitions (logical drives). I&rsquo;ve used a newer drive, and I erased the whole disk, without making any partitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Validate Software Write Blocker</strong></p>
<p>In order to validate the software WB, uplug the drive, turn the WriteBlocker on, plug the drive back in and run some software capable of calculating the hash of a drive (FTK Imager, for example). Then document the result. This is a <strong>pre-hash value</strong>. Remove the drive from FTK and close the tool (in order to prevent it reading from cache). Try writing something to the drive or changing a file and then follow the above steps again. The hash values should be the same!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Make sure to run the hashing funciton against the physical drive, not the logical one!</p>

<h2 id="capturing-the-scene-">Capturing the scene ✍️</h2>
<h3 id="prepare-documentation">Prepare documentation</h3>
<p>Start documenting even before you get to the scene.</p>
<p><img src="images/chain-of-custody.png" alt="chain-of-custody"></p>
<h3 id="identify-the-evidence">Identify the evidence</h3>
<p>Assign IDs for each evidence. For example, for a flash drive it would look like this. FD (flash drive) + its <em>sequence number</em> within this case + case number. Subsequent images of these devices will have the same number + copy&rsquo;s sequence number.</p>
<p>Example: <em>A USB Flash drive was found on the scene during case study 0124. It was the first USB drive found yet. This device was assigned a number FD-01-0124. Then we made two bit-by-bit copies of this drive and these were assigned numbers FD-01-0124-01 and FD-01-0124-02 respectively.</em></p>
<h3 id="take-photos-and-videos">Take photos and videos</h3>
<p>First, make sure that timestamps are configured on both devices. Take as many photos and videos as possible. Take overall and close-up photos. Make sure that all the connections between the devices are photographed clearly. Photograph the evidence in situ (if possible).</p>
<h3 id="documenting">Documenting</h3>
<p>Document the evidence (where found, by whom, make, model, serial number, etc.).</p>

<h3 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t contaminate the scene (try not to be tempted to eat buiscuits 🍪 and burgers 🍔 on the scene, however hard that might seem). This means, that you should also preserve the physical evidence as well. Don&rsquo;t touch ANYTHING before the lead investigator says &ldquo;OK&rdquo; 👍. Always mind the scope and get it in writing even if it&rsquo;s not a crimial case. Do fingerprints need to be collected? DNA?</p>
<p>What types of evidence can I come across?</p>
<ul>
<li>Obvious - PC, cameras, flash drives, PDAs, removable media. Mind the chain of custody. Document the physical condition (mouse to left or right as the owner is a lefty or a righty), applications running, keep audio notes.</li>
<li>Non-obvious
<ul>
<li>manuals for devices that were not found - look for these devices</li>
<li>digital media taken with some device that was not found -look for this device</li>
<li>Sticky notes or liitle papers with scrambled notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to consider when acquiring a PC is wether it&rsquo;s turned on or off?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Then transport it as is. Do not forget the charger!</li>
<li>No. Depending on the case nature, turn off or perform the RAM capture.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mobile">Mobile</h4>
<p>There are several way to acquire a live/dead image of a mobile device. Thing to note - it&rsquo;s not trivial.</p>
<p><strong>Manual</strong>. Scrolling through the phone&rsquo;s contents using GUI. <strong>Tools</strong> 🛠: fingers 😃.</p>
<p><strong>Logical</strong>. Extracting logical storage objects: folders, files, directories.  Sync with computer. Most often than not doesn&rsquo;t include deleted items (other than cases when app has a bin). Doesn&rsquo;t include unallocated space. Second best option. <strong>Tools</strong> 🛠:</p>
<p><strong>Physical.</strong> The most desired and the hardest to do. There several ways to do a physical acquisition with a mobile device.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bit by bit copy.</strong> Direct access to flash memory (non-volatile). Copies all data, including deleted and unallocated space. First best option.</li>
<li><strong>Hex dumping</strong>. Requires uploading a modified boot loader into RAM on the device. The mobile devices is connected to the PC via flasher box. They were not designed for forensic purposes and one needs to know what she&rsquo;s doing. Device is places in a diagnostic mode. However, flasher boxes have some limitations: requires rebooting (-&gt; auth mechanisms activated and further analysis impossible), data encrypted, only certain ranges might be available, confisuing to use. <strong>Tools</strong> 🛠:</li>
<li><strong>JTAG</strong>. Some devices have special hardware intefaces to test hardware and firmware. One needs a JTAG adapter. One end connects to the mobile device&rsquo;s motherboard and another one - to the PC. <a href="https://gsmserver.ru/riff-box-2/">Here</a> is a tool that I might buy in fiture in order to improve my skills in mobile forensics. Special software is used to interpret the results. JTAG adapter requests memory addresses from the mobile. Works for locked or damaged devices.  <strong>Tools</strong> 🛠:</li>
<li><strong>Chip-Off.</strong> The memory is physically removed and a bit-by-bit copy is made. This is like imaging good old HDDs. But to provide the examiner with contiguous binary format, wear-leveling algorithm [<a href="https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/technical-note/nand-flash/tn2942_nand_wear_leveling.pdf">4</a>] must first be reverse engineered. There are lots of chip types and therefore, myrad of different raw data formats. JTAG is more preferable, since this technique (chip-off) mugh damage the device. <strong>Tools</strong> 🛠:</li>
<li><strong>Micro Read</strong>. For high profile methods only since requires an electronic microscope 🔬 and also a good technical knowledge. Using the microscope, one is observing the state of the gates of a NAND or NOR chips. <strong>Tools</strong> 🛠: No commercial tools currently exist to perform this task 😔.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Micro read</strong>. Physical extraction. Manually viewing and interpreting data as seen on the memory chip using 🔬 microscope and translating gate status to 💯 zeroes and ones and then interpret them as ASCII chars. Usually done when national security is at risk. Otherwise it&rsquo;s too hard, expensive and no commercial tools available. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-mobile-forensics/9781788839198/ac5758e4-e433-46e9-b396-c5cd29638a82.xhtml">Link</a>. Interesting <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/sc99-tamper.pdf">article</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Chip-off</strong>. Physical extraction. Chip is removed, the second phone is used to extract data. Requires soldering and heating of chips, may render the data unsalvageable 💩 . Useless with iOS &gt;= 5S due to SecEnclave 👮‍♂️ . Try below methods before trying this. When it&rsquo;s important to preserve memory or when the device is damaged and the chip is the only thing that survived. ❗ Usable when the device is screenlocked.</li>
<li><strong>Hex Dump</strong>. Physical extraction. Connect to forensic machine, push unsigned code/bootloader. Extract memory in binary format. ❗ Usable when the device is screenlocked.  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190012/">JTAG</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Logical Analysis</strong>. Logical extraction. Connect to forensic machine (USB, Bluetooth, SSH ❓ etc). Might change the integrity of the evidence. Deleted data is not accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Extraction</strong>. ✋ 📱 Manual extraction. Scroll through data on the phone, see everything that mobile&rsquo;s GUI offers you, using touchscreen, buttons and keypad (messages 💌 , photos 🌄 , videos 📹 , notes 🗒 , browser history 📖 etc).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="write-blockers">Write Blockers</h3>
<p>There are hardware and software write blockers. They both ensure that the changes are not made to target media when plugging in disks or flash drives. InfoSec course recommends using hardware blockers instead of software whenever possible. However if the hardware option is not available, software are acceptable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔎 Why?</p>
<p>✍️ They have a dedicated firmware which is independent of the target OS. That means they work with any OS and any BIOS version. Software writeblockers are not reliable. Some of them do not work at all, some don&rsquo;t work for specific drives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/bizone/blog/320032/">this</a> article on habr which is a research whether software write blockers are worse than hardware ones. Write blocker needs to validated prior to imaging on a small drive in every investigation!</p>
<h4 id="software-write-blockers">Software Write Blockers</h4>
<p>For Windows 🛠: Safe Block 💰, FastBloc SE (EnCase module) 💰; for USB ports: <a href="https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Security-Related/Thumbscrew.shtml">Thuscrew</a> (flips the bit in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies\WriteProtect</code>), <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbwriteblockerforwindows8/files/latest/download">USB Write Blocker for Windows</a>.</p>
<h3 id="package-and-transport">Package and transport</h3>
<p>Package the evidence for transport. Transport the evidence. Store the evidence while in possession. Use Faraday bags for avoiding remote tampering, anti-static and plastic bags as a protection from discharge and moisture. Tape and seal the bags with the evidence.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-preservation">Evidence Preservation</h2>
<p>Keep in mind the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/exchange-principle#:~:text=Locard's%20Exchange%20Principle%20states%20that,pollen%2C%20paint%2C%20and%20soil.">Locard&rsquo;s Exchange Principle</a>. To keep the evidence safe and admissable in court, document everything. When acquiring data from memory, use write blockers (soft- or hardware-based). If the device is off, don&rsquo;t turn it on. If it&rsquo;s on - take photos 📸 of all windows, note running applications and processes (mind destructive processes and encryption 🔐). If you see a destructive process running, pull the plug from the PC (not the wall), take out the battery or shut it down immediatly. You need to be able to identify at least some of disk-wiping software. However, some of them might be command line and get triggered when USB is plugged in (<a href="/docs/dfir/antiforensics/usbkill-switch">kill switch</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🗒 Make a list of the most popular disk-wipers with their icons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid remote wiping or evidence tampering - RF shielding (Faraday bag).</p>
<p>To prevent battery loss (in case we need the device to be on), keep the device connected to the power supply (for example, portable). ⚠️ Turning off might trigger encryption!</p>
<p>Document the changes that you are making. Know your tools 🛠! What changes they are making (<a href="https://peat-chameleon-e41.notion.site/bf3cb04f2a074cfc816f853cec92d783?v=f8cbcf21bcb641b6806fb22decfccf9f">see</a>).</p>
