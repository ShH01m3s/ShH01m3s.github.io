<h2 id="prioritise-and-pivot">Prioritise And Pivot</h2>
<p>There are different paths to follow to answer the same questions. Some are more efficient.</p>
<p>I am pulling on threads.  Find a piece of evidence and focus on that to fully understand it. Example (depth search):</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for malware and finding program run entries for malware</li>
<li>Stop looking for other malware and focus on that one.
<ul>
<li>What happened before and after?</li>
<li>What else is in the same folder?</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat for each you find</li>
</ul>
<p>How to find the first evidence? Prioritise or brute force.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritise (Manual). You always need to find out where the evidence is going to be.
<ul>
<li>impact on the investigation result</li>
<li>likelihood of finding anything</li>
<li>False positive?</li>
<li>time required</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Brute force</strong> (Automated). Let tools and software find evidence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyber Triage: can I mark something as wrong and run the analysis for this piece of evidence again? - yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the general schema <a href="/files/pdf/DivideAndConquerDiag202010-201008-094835.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea is to concentrate on some areas and answer some specific questions, like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there child exploitation material? Search videos and pictures.</li>
<li>Is this PC compromised? It needs to be more prominent.</li>
<li>Who did this computer communicate with?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First option:</strong></p>
<p>Big problem &ndash;&gt; n*(minor problem). Recursively break a problem into minor issues until one becomes solvable.</p>
<p><strong>Second option:</strong></p>
<p>Or we can be guided by artefact ⛏️  categories.</p>
<p>First, break the more significant problem into smaller ones. Then answer questions with artefact ⛏️ categories.</p>

<h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge assumptions</strong> (sometimes it&rsquo;s something you have not seen or dealt with before), consider alternatives, evaluate data, identify critical drivers, and understand the context.</p>
<p>List all assumptions and ask yourself how sure you are of these statements and what might happen if they are wrong. Categorise these assumptions based on certainty. Refine and remove those assumptions that are proven to be incorrect. Identify additional data needs for those assumptions that are still uncertain. Research?</p>
<p>Think about the <strong>alternatives</strong>, for example, brainstorming. Ask yourself the six W&rsquo;s to help develop the other options. The null hypothesis is the opposite of the central hypothesis (for anomalous data).</p>
<p>Know your data! <strong>Know normal and abnormal</strong>. Establish the baselines for average to detect the bizarre (like, a clean system installation is examined, and everything is compared to it). Look for inconsistent data. **Assess the data against different hypotheses to see how well it fits.</p>
<p>Identify critical drivers: technology, regulatory (laws and standards), society (politics, people want to be safe), supply chain (logistics, cost, scheduling, customer requirements), employees (skills and training needed), threat actors (tech capabilities, motives, opportunity).</p>
<p>Understand the context from the perspective of different stakeholders. Framing techniques help keep everyone on the same page (what do they need from me, how can I frame the issue, do I need to place their questions in a broader context). Same vocabulary. Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key components. Break the problem down and identify the parts, actors and categories.</li>
<li>Factors at Play.</li>
<li>Relationships. Static? Dynamic? Graphing.</li>
<li>Similarities/Differences. Leverage past work!</li>
<li>Redefine. Rephrase and paraphrase the issue. What is the root cause?</li>
</ul>

<p>Lot&rsquo;s of attacks involve account compromise. In some cases malware is not even needed. There are several arguments for the defence: <em>I didn&rsquo;t know</em>, <em>It was not me</em>, <em>It was a malware</em> and <em>It happened accidently</em>.</p>
<p>✍️ <strong>Suspicious logins?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Should this user use this account?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Are they new to the computer?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> If remote, does the account usually come from that computer?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Is the time expected?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Does the account have lots of failed logins? 👉 <em>A very strong indicator of compromise</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> A login during time when the user was absent 👉 <em>A very strong indicator of compromise</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✍️ <strong>Malware</strong>. There is a separate section for malware, but it can be a strong defense for some one claiming his or her account was compromised. But! ⚠️ Even if there is a malware found, it&rsquo;s essential to prove that it existed <strong>at the time</strong> that some investigated activity took place.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-prove-intent-">How to prove intent ❓</h3>

<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> File accessed soon after creation? 👉 <em>Might be an indicator of some automated task, or not&hellip;.</em>.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Was a file deleted/wiped? 👉 <em>File wiped is a strong indiator of intent.</em> 🛠 Directory Snoop can show that the file was wiped, not simply deleted. Not all wiping software clears the <code>$MFT</code> table.</li>

<h3 id="how-to-prove-user-awareness-">How to prove user awareness ❓</h3>
<p>✍️ It&rsquo;s often not enough just to find a file on a system. One needs to prove <strong>the intent</strong>. Remember to use more than one artifact whenever possible! For example, the user may be insisting that he or she did not download this file. But, if the browser was set to flush data every 7 days and the timestamps for the deleted file shows it was deleted an hour after it was deleted - this might raiser some reasonable doubt I think 🤔. Or, the file was wiped 🧹 (it&rsquo;s contents filled with <code>0</code>s). If one didn&rsquo;t know it existed, why delete it? Or there is no data on the PC indicating the use of the file, but it was continuously downloaded/uploaded according to the server logs. ⚠️ This, however, won&rsquo;t prove that there was no hacker in place!</p>
<h3 id="types-of-users-1">Types of Users</h3>
<p>Actually, as I read further an further, it seems that everything is about a user. But!</p>
<p>A user can be of several categories. I&rsquo;ll name each one as shortly as I can to refer to them in future. But I will describe them in more detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate user, who has done something bad by accident</strong>. Let&rsquo;s call him a <strong>dummy</strong> 😬. I&rsquo;ve been there, I once changed permissions to <code>Deny</code> for my admin account to disk <code>C</code> on Windows and could do nothing about it later. How stupid was it 🙈? My excuse is that I only started with PCs&hellip; .</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate user, who has done something bad by intent.</strong> Let&rsquo;s call this one a <strong>poopy</strong> 💩. Say, he or she feels highy underpaid and sells company&rsquo;s kitty plans to some evil dog hackers.</p>
<p><strong>A user created and used by a hacker.</strong> This one I will call a <strong>sheep</strong> 🐑  as in <em>A wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing</em>, since the attacker is trying mask itself as something good.  This one is not unusual, but I guess, easily determined by the sysadmin. However, there are some cases, when an attacker can change view permissions for his/her account on AD so that no one will see this user.</p>
<p><strong>A user created legitimately, but compromised by a hacker and doing something by intent.</strong> This one will be a <strong>donkey</strong> 🦓, as the attaker is using another account for his ride. I guess it&rsquo;s the most common when the hackers are in the picture.</p>
<p>And here are the questions we will have to answer during investigations, that can help in distinguishing between these types.</p>
<h4 id="dummy--vs-poopy-"><strong>Dummy</strong> 😬 vs <strong>Poopy</strong> 💩</h4>
<p><em>❓ How to prove that the person didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose, but by accident?</em></p>

<p>✍️ <strong>Are there suspicious accounts?</strong> 👣 SAM reg hive (local and domain). Even if the account is deleted, then you can still spot it: user directory sometimes is retained and also check logs. The below question may help finding a malicious user (hacker).
