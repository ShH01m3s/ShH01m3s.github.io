<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification/Assessment</strong>. Understand your scope (technical and legal aspects), your goals and people you are going to work with. Identify the stakeholders. Decide on the tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collection/Acquisition</strong>. Begins with first response and arriving to the scene. Everything must be recorded and documented. Opponents will try to discredit your work. Use industry accepted tools. Know the digital footprint of these tools. Document everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation</li>
<li>Capturing the Scene</li>
<li>Presetving Evidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preservation</strong>. Making extra copies of all media. Don&rsquo;t examine and analyse the original. Calculate hashes. If there is no way to copy - document why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examination</strong>. Document each step taken. Might take audio notes. There is no court-approved tools: use familiar tools. If it&rsquo;s a new tool, demonstrate the proficiency and your testing of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>. Art supersedes science. Know what is garbage. Unexpected places. Don&rsquo;t ignore exculpatory (proving innocence) data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong>. Begins at the very beginning and goes on until the last day. Document EVERYTHING! Know the laws. If you don&rsquo;t know something, ask.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>civil (constitutional law may not apply but privacy legislation is likely to)</li>
<li>criminal (usually leads to arrest)</li>
<li>internal (not intended for others to see)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stakeholders - everyone investing their money 💵, time 🕰 or effort into the company. So, employees are also stakeholders. Some of them might become my opponents or proponents. Scope!</p>
<h2 id="collection">Collection</h2>
<p>Before anything can be acquired, it needs to be properly documented first. First responders first arrive on the scene. Not always they are digital forensic experts. Here is a checklist for first responder:</p>
<h3 id="first-responders-checklist">First Responder&rsquo;s Checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓All photos taken before touching the scene?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Chain of custody properly carried out?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Remove evidence drive from the PC</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Sanitize the target disk</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Is all the write blocker to be used verified prior to this investigation?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Is the imaging software verified according to the policy or at least once a month? (the whole drive is imaged)?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Connect the write blocker to the PC and the evidence drive to the write blocker (power + data cables)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <em>❓Is the WB option on?</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Calculate <strong>the hash of the evidence drive</strong> (pre-hash). Document it.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Image the evidence.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Calculate the <strong>hash of the original evidence</strong> again, validate the hash and document it.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Calculate the <strong>hash of the image that was taken</strong> (post-hash) and make sure it matches the above ones taken previously.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-scene-tools">On-scene Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>A PC technician&rsquo;s toolkit 🧰 (screwdrivers 🪛, squeezers, scissors✂️ , portable batteries 🔋and etc) to be able to remove HDD, lockdown cables etc) ✅.</li>
<li>Digital camera 📸  that embed timestamps on the photos. 📝 Take photos, the more the better!</li>
<li>Video camera 📹. 📝 Take a video, the longer the better.</li>
<li>For labeling and documenting (labels, markers, pens, 🖊, evidence tape 🚧).</li>
<li>Transporting and managing evidence 💼 (Faraday bag , Anti-static bag, evidence log, large envelopes ✉️,  gloves🧤, sanitizer, ).</li>
<li>Documents (chain of custody, notes 🗒, warrants/subpoenas).</li>
<li>Digital forensics specifics (forensics software, write blockers, laptop 💻, sterilize target media, flash drives for live/dead acquisition, bootable).</li>
</ul>
<p>Develop a plan to collect the data. Each type of data will require separate plan. This plan should prioritise the sources and the order. For example, if you are dealing with a system that is turned on, first, take photos of the screen, then collect the volatile data (RAM) and them make a copy of a hard drive. Then turn it off and send to the lab in a safety bag. Maintain chain of custody.</p>
<p>Then, acquire the data, i.e. follow the plan. Use forensic tools to collect volatile data, duplicate non-volatile data, secure the original data source.</p>
<p>Verify the integrity of this data.</p>
<p>Keep the evidence isolated and document the scene thouruoughly. Assign IDs to the acquired evidence. Make sure, these evidence are in the scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ It&rsquo;s a very important thing to note in case of IP (intellectual property cases). Ensure, that data and devices of the suspect are IMMEDIATLY preserved and not accessed by anyone. I guess that&rsquo;s because of the timestamps.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>❓ <em>What is the case about?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❓ <em>What evidence do we expect to recover?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❓ <em>Where is the evidence most likely located?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❓ <em>What are the legal restrictions?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❓ <em>Who is involved and what&rsquo;s their role?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prepare-documentation">Prepare documentation</h3>
<p>Start documenting even before you get to the scene.</p>
<p><img src="/Users/veronicazvereva/Documents/website/analyst/content/docs/dfir/host/collection/overview/images/chain-of-custody.png" alt="chain-of-custody"></p>
<h3 id="identify-the-evidence">Identify the evidence</h3>
<p>Assign IDs for each evidence. For example, for a flash drive it would look like this. FD (flash drive) + its <em>sequence number</em> within this case + case number. Subsequent images of these devices will have the same number + copy&rsquo;s sequence number.</p>
<p>Example: <em>A USB Flash drive was found on the scene during case study 0124. It was the first USB drive found yet. This device was assigned a number FD-01-0124. Then we made two bit-by-bit copies of this drive and these were assigned numbers FD-01-0124-01 and FD-01-0124-02 respectively.</em></p>
<h3 id="take-photos-and-videos">Take photos and videos</h3>
<p>First, make sure that timestamps are configured on both devices. Take as many photos and videos as possible. Take overall and close-up photos. Make sure that all the connections between the devices are photographed clearly. Photograph the evidence in situ (if possible).</p>
<h3 id="documenting">Documenting</h3>
<p>Document the evidence (where found, by whom, make, model, serial number, etc.).</p>

<h3 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t contaminate the scene (try not to be tempted to eat buiscuits 🍪 and burgers 🍔 on the scene, however hard that might seem). This means, that you should also preserve the physical evidence as well. Don&rsquo;t touch ANYTHING before the lead investigator says &ldquo;OK&rdquo; 👍. Always mind the scope and get it in writing even if it&rsquo;s not a crimial case. Do fingerprints need to be collected? DNA?</p>
<p>What types of evidence can I come across?</p>
<ul>
<li>Obvious - PC, cameras, flash drives, PDAs, removable media. Mind the chain of custody. Document the physical condition (mouse to left or right as the owner is a lefty or a righty), applications running, keep audio notes.</li>
<li>Non-obvious
<ul>
<li>manuals for devices that were not found - look for these devices</li>
<li>digital media taken with some device that was not found -look for this device</li>
<li>Sticky notes or liitle papers with scrambled notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to consider when acquiring a PC is wether it&rsquo;s turned on or off?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Then transport it as is. Do not forget the charger!</li>
<li>No. Depending on the case nature, turn off or perform the RAM capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, about the RAM capture. Here is the order of volatility (processes &gt; network connections &gt; routing tables &gt; passwords):</p>
<ol>
<li>Regisrers and cache. How to collect them? What&rsquo;s registers? CPU or &hellip;?</li>
<li>Routing tables, ARP cache, process tables, kernel statistics, memory
<ol>
<li>Windows - <code>route print | more</code></li>
<li>Linux -  <code>ip route</code></li>
<li>Mac OSX - <code>netstat -rn</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Temporary file systems?</li>
<li>Disk</li>
<li>Remote logging and monitoring data that is revelevant to the system in question</li>
<li>Physical configuration, network topolgy</li>
<li>Archival media</li>
</ol>
<p>⚠️ In case of live capture, mind that there might be a kill switch somewhere or a rootkit that will deem all unusable the moment you try doing something.</p>
<p>Along with the device itself, document and acquire sub-items as well (attached USBs and other stuff, manuals, papers, adapters etc).</p>
<p>Now, what about each device type acquisition specifics?</p>
<p>🍏 Apple Acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>. On the forensic Macbook turn off disk arbitration or use write blockers. To turn off this feature refer to <a href="https://forensicswiki.xyz/wiki/index.php?title=Disabling_Macintosh_Disk_Arbitration_Daemon">this</a> page. It&rsquo;s needed so that the forensic machine won&rsquo;t make changes to the data on the suspect Macbook. For Mac acquisition - follow <a href="https://forensicswiki.xyz/wiki/index.php?title=Acquiring_a_MacOS_System_with_Target_Disk_Mode">these</a> steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❓<em>What files are changed when something is connected to a Mac (USB or using Thunderbolt)? Is turning off the disk arbitration feature really prevents the changed being made to the target drive?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>.</p>
<p>🪟 Windows Acquisition</p>
<p>🐧 Linux Acquisition.</p>
<p>🤖 Android Acquisition</p>
<h2 id="preservation">Preservation</h2>
<p>Package the evidence for transport. Transport the evidence. Store the evidence while in possession. Use Faraday bags for avoiding remote tampering, anti-static and plastic bags as a protection from discharge and moisture. Tape and seal the bags with the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Preservation</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/exchange-principle#:~:text=Locard's%20Exchange%20Principle%20states%20that,pollen%2C%20paint%2C%20and%20soil.">Locard&rsquo;s Exchange Principle</a>. To keep the evidence safe and admissable in court, document everything. When acquiring data from memory, use write blockers (soft- or hardware-based). If the device is off, don&rsquo;t turn it on. If it&rsquo;s on - take photos 📸 of all windows, note running applications and processes (mind destructive processes and encryption 🔐). If you see a destructive process running, pull the plug from the PC (not the wall), take out the battery or shut it down immediatly. You need to be able to identify at least some of disk-wiping software. However, some of them might be command line and get triggered when USB is plugged in (<a href="/docs/dfir/antiforensics/usbkill-switch">kill switch</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🗒 Make a list of the most popular disk-wipers with their icons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid remote wiping or evidence tampering - RF shielding (Faraday bag).</p>
<p>To prevent battery loss (in case we need the device to be on), keep the device connected to the power supply (for example, portable). ⚠️ Turning off might trigger encryption!</p>
<p>Document the changes that you are making. Know your tools 🛠! What changes they are making (<a href="https://peat-chameleon-e41.notion.site/bf3cb04f2a074cfc816f853cec92d783?v=f8cbcf21bcb641b6806fb22decfccf9f">see</a>).</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Obtain and image or physical evidence to work with. For Android, to see installed apps and recent activity:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>packages.list</code></li>
<li><code>packages.xml</code> - to see permissions for <strong>all</strong> applications in one place. For example, if this application has a SMS or messaging permission, you&rsquo;ll know to look. Or, for example, I need all applications that have chat permissions or access to camera.</li>
<li>com.vending.adnroid</li>
<li>usagestats</li>
<li>usage history</li>
<li>battery stats</li>
<li>recent images</li>
<li>snapshots</li>
</ul>
<p>tccb on iOS?</p>
<p>Chromebook - extension preferences file.</p>
<p>Run commercial tools to parse the info. If not, then try to find some specific parser, may be for similar app and try.</p>
<p>Create profiles and you any real data for generation.</p>
<p>Fake data - mockaroo and generatedata.com</p>
<ol>
<li>take the snapshot of the system state before populating with data</li>
<li>Write a script-plan</li>
<li>take notes</li>
<li>perform actions 1 min apart</li>
<li>scrrencap actions</li>
<li>document them (log with script)</li>
<li>compare with the the baseline &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; from step 1.</li>

<p>Do not make assumptions before testing! For example, a QuizUp game folder contained some usernames and pictures and the assumption would be that this person was in touch with the suspect. However, testing revealed that when you choose to randomly find you a rival from around the globe 🌎, QuizUp automatically adds them to the player&rsquo;s contacts.</p>
<p>Jessica advices to use appropriate view-managers for specific files, but I would also recommend to check these files in hex as well. There was once a case when I performed vulnerability assessment of a mobile application and I got a SQLite DB, opened it in SQLite Browser DB and couldn&rsquo;t find the data I was looking for. However <code>grep</code>  command showed that this data <em>was</em> in the DB. I opened it in hex and noticed that it might have been damaged because there was an amount of data almoust the same size as the visible one, that was not shown in the viewer. Perhaps that were some deleted rows or the DB <em>was</em> damaged indeed.</p>
<p>Applications of different versions or platforms may have different data structure. For example, iOS QuizUp had a geolocation field, while Android didn&rsquo;t at that point in time.	[<a href="https://www.eccu.edu/methodology-for-testing-forensic-hypothesis-and-finding-truth/#attend">1</a>]</p>
<p>=====</p>
<h2 id="examination--analysis">Examination &amp; Analysis</h2>
<p>Bypassing controls (if, say, it&rsquo;s PIN protected, data encrypted, ACL, compression). There will be lots of data and only some is relevant. In most cases, NSRL file data is used to eliminate known files, such as operating system and application files, during criminal forensic investigations. This reduces the number of files which must be manually examined and thus increases the efficiency of the investigation.

<p>Main idea is to concentrate on some areas, answer some specific questions, like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there child exploitation material? Search videos and pictures.</li>
<li>Is this PC compromised? Not obvious.</li>
<li>Who did this computer communicate with?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First option:</strong></p>
<p>Big problem &ndash;&gt; n*(small problem). Recursively break a problem into smaller problems until one of them becomes solvable.</p>
<p><strong>Second option:</strong></p>
<p>Or we can be guided by artifact ⛏️  categories.</p>
<p>First, break the bigger problem into a smaller one. Then answer questions with artifact ⛏️ categories.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-forensics">File System Forensics</h3>
<p>Digital crime scene investigation process consists of the following phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preservation phase</strong>. Reduce the amount of evidence that can be overwritten.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence searching phase.</strong> Look for data that support of refute a hypothesis. Determine what you are looking for and where do we expect to find it. Files are searched either of the following ways: name, keyword in the contents, signature or timestamps. Compare to hash DBs. Networkingk packets (src and dst IPs).</li>
<li><strong>Event reconstruction</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="ntfs-vs-apfs">NTFS vs APFS</h4>
<p>Mind that APFS <a href="/docs/articles/forensics/analysis/11-apple/mac-artifacts">timestamps</a> and NTFS <a href="/docs/articles/forensics/analysis/13-windows/win-artifacts">timestamps</a> are different! With NTFS when you add a file to the system (for example, copy it from USB drive), the MAC times are changed. However, on APFS <em>Added</em> attribute is added, providing you with slightly more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Both for APFS and NTFS last accessed times might not be updated. Refer to the artifacts page mentioned above for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation</strong></p>
<p>Correlate data with other independent sources. Some data might have been tampered with and you should try to find other evidence that describe the same data. For example, timestamps can be easily changed. Therefore, try to find network or login events to correlate them.</p>
<p><strong>Logging</strong></p>

<h3 id="user-activity">User Activity</h3>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s of attacks involve account compromise. In this case sometimes malware is not even needed. There are several arguments for the defence: <em>I didn&rsquo;t know</em>, <em>It was not me</em>, <em>It was a malware</em> and <em>It happened accidently</em>. So, it&rsquo;s often not enough just to find a file on a system. One needs to prove the <em>intent</em>. Remember to use more than one artifact whenever possible. For example, the user may be insisting that he or she did not download this file. But, if the browser was set to flush data every 7 days and the timestamps for the deleted file shows it was deleted an hour after it was deleted - this might raiser some reasonable doubt. Or, the file was wiped (it&rsquo;s contents filled with <code>0</code>s). If one didn&rsquo;t know it existed, why delete it? Or there is no data on the PC indicating the use of the file, but it was continuously downloaded/uploaded according to the server logs.</p>
<p>First, determine if the was any malicious user activity.</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <strong>Are there suspicious accounts?</strong> 👣 SAM reg hive (local and domain). Even if the account is deleted, then you can still spot it: user directory sometimes is retained and also check logs. The below question may help finding a malicious user (hacker).

</ul>
</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> <strong>Suspicious activity?</strong> 👣 User started processes (Event log, RunMRU, MUICache, UserAssist, AppCompatCache or Shimcache, BAM (Background activity monitor), RecentApps, RecentFilecache or AmCache, SRUM (system resource usage monitor), Windows Timeline, Prefetch). ⚠️ Even if there is a malware found, it&rsquo;s essential to prove that it existed at the time that some investigated activity took place.

<h3 id="malware">Malware</h3>
<p>APT - smarter malware.</p>
<p>Needs to start (one time or regulary on startup or schedule; or trick the user), hides itself, wicked stuff done. Launch malware instead of leg prog by placing it in the same directory if the full path is specified. Trick process to launch malicious library. For example, DLL injection. See the presentation <a href="/files/presentations/Injects_p1.pptx">here</a> and <a href="/files/presentations/Injects_p2.pptx">here</a>.  Data injection (exploit).</p>
<p>Hide itself, modify OS data structs to make itself invisble from some APIs. Parasite (Hijack another process with malthreads). Hollowing etc.</p>
<p>Triggered, trick launch and trick load.</p>
<p>Is it malicious?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hash (Threat Intelligence)</li>
<li>Byte-level signatures from previous malware?</li>
<li>Mal behaviour?</li>
<li>Reverse - mal instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>❓ <em>What A/V solution is being used?</em> 🦠 🛑 If it&rsquo;s Windows, there might be just Windows Defender or some third-party AV. Find the logs for this particular AV solution. More <a href="/docs/dfir/host/windows/windows-artifacts#av-logs">here</a> about this Windows artifact. As for macOS, it has a built-in gatekeeper which logs all these alerts and can even detect known malware.

<p>There are different paths to follow to answer the same questions. Some are more efficitent.</p>
<p>Pulling on threads.  Find a piece of evidence and focus on that to fully understand it. Example (depth search):</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for malware and find program run entry for malware</li>
<li>Stop looking for other malware and focus on that one
<ul>
<li>What happened before and after?</li>
<li>What else is in the same folder?</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>

<h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge assumptions</strong> (sometimes its something you have not seen or dealt with before), consider alternatives, evaluate data, identify key drivers, understand context.</p>
<p>List all assumptions and ask yourself how sure you are of these statements and what might happen if they are wrong. Categorize these assumptions based on the certainty. Refine and remove those assumptions that are proven to be wrong. Identify addition data needs for those assumptions that are still uncertain. Research?</p>
<p>Think about the <strong>alternatives</strong>, for example, brainstorming. Ask yourself the six W&rsquo;s to help develop the alternatives. Null hypothesis - the opposite to the main hypothesis (for anomalous data).</p>
<p>Know your data! <strong>Know normal and abnormal</strong>. Establish the baselines for normal to be able to detect the abnormal (like, a clean installation of a system is examined and everything is then compared to it). Look for incosistent data. <strong>Assess the data against different hypothesis</strong> to see how well it fits.</p>
<p>Identify key drivers: technology, regulatory (laws and standards), society (politics, people want to be safe), supply chain (logistics, cost, scheduling, customer requirements), employees (skills and training needed), threat actors (tech capabilities, motives, opportunity).</p>
<p>Understand the context from the perspective of different stakeholders. Framing techniques help keep everyone on the same page (what do they need from me, how can I frame the issue, do I need to place their questions in a broader context). Same vocabulary. Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key components. Break the problem down and identify the partss, actors and categories.</li>
<li>Factors at Play.</li>
<li>Relationships. Static? Dynamic? Graphing.</li>
<li>Similarities/Differences. Leverage the past work!</li>
<li>Redefine. Rephrase and paraphrase the issue. What is the root cause?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all the files are worth considering. However, it&rsquo;s hard to keep all of them in mind. So, I&rsquo;ve made (about to) several database files that contain information on files on a clean installed system. There will be some diviations, I presume, but I hope it will help eliminate a huge pack of files as well.</p>

<h3 id="exfiltration">Exfiltration</h3>
<p>It usually means that someone has leaked some confidential information. It also usually means, that the person would exfiltrate it to one person only, i.e. you would be looking for e-mail or chat conversations invlolving just two parties (no CC or BCC).</p>
