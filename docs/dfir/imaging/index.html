    <p><em>There are two types of acquisitions: live 🍀 and dead ☠️. Choosing based on the system&rsquo;s initial state in question is usually preferable. So, for example, if the system is turned on, perform live acquisition first, capturing all volatile data that will be deleted after reboot. Otherwise, jump right to the dead acquisition (if the system is shut down).</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ There are some caveats which need to be handled, though. For example, at the moment of this writing (📆 <code>11/07/2022</code>), macOS has introduced Share Disk mode for the newest M1 machines. Unlike the Target disk mode, which would treat the disk as external, making it possible to turn on the write blocker, this new mode is more like a network share and works over SMB (over the wire). This way, the target disk won&rsquo;t show with the <code>diskutil</code> list; thus, all standard procedures for write blocking won&rsquo;t work. I don&rsquo;t know if an ordinary physical write blocker will work since the mechanism is different. I have posted this question on <a href="https://www.forensicfocus.com/forums/general/apple-silicon-m1-chip-based-computers/">forensicfocus.com</a> but have not received any updates.</p>

<h3 id="macos">macOS</h3>
<p>For newer MacBooks, it gets tricky. I posted the question <a href="https://www.forensicfocus.com/forums/general/apple-silicon-m1-chip-based-computers/">here</a>. No answer still (📆 <code>02/08/2022</code>).</p>
<p>At first, Mac imaging was no different from imaging other devices running other OS (Windows or Linux). But then they added Fusion Drives which was quite a trouble for analysts. Samuri stumbled upon it, and they had to work this out. But after T2, Mac imaging has become even more painful since it&rsquo;s impossible to image a drive without a password and another Mac even if File Vault is turned off. At the moment, Mac forensics resembles iOS forensics because there is probably little you can do without a password. There used to be some disk mode in which one could perform imaging, but now it doesn&rsquo;t work without a passcode.</p>
<p>Another interesting key point is that the kill signal can now be sent over Bluetooth. That means if someone with Bluetooth enabled on the crime scene, the owner of the evidence (Mac device) could send a command to wipe his notebook leveraged through the investigator&rsquo;s Bluetooth. It sounds made up, but a Mac forensics expert said this is what it looks like now.</p>
<p>Also, they talked about the <a href="https://sumuri.com/product/recon-itr/">ITR</a> tool that images and triages Mac devices. Supports live images of Apple Silicon Macs!</p>
<h4 id="fusion-drives">Fusion Drives</h4>
<p>A fusion drive combines an ordinary drive and a small NAND flash drive that appear as one logical volume in the OS. Still, when you try imaging it, you&rsquo;ll get two different images, and the image will be somewhat corrupted for the analysis tools if you don&rsquo;t assemble it correctly. NAND flash drive stores the most often used files like system ones and those the user uses more often than others. The idea seems to be the same as with prefetch in Windows 🌈.</p>
<h4 id="target-disk-intel">Target Disk (Intel)</h4>
<p>I have an old MacBook (see <a href="/blog/2020/10/how-i-broke-my-husbands-macbook">this</a> blog post) and a new one with an M1 chip. Following the instruction from the Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/surviving-digital-forensics-imaging-a-mac-fusion-drive/learn/lecture/2534096?start=1#content">course</a> of Michael Leclair, I&rsquo;ve bought a Thunderbolt2-Thunderbolt3 cable to connect these two PCs. I&rsquo;ve tried this and this first, but they worked only for connecting Displays. However, whatever line I tried using, I needed something to work. I then tried the Apple ones, but these did not work either. I have run across this text on official Apple docs for the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This adapter is bidirectional so that you can connect Thunderbolt 3 devices to a Mac with a Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 port. In that case, the Mac must use <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201260">macOS Sierra or later</a>, and the device using Thunderbolt 3 must provide its power. [<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207266">5</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there are two prerequisites:</p>
<ol>
<li>macOS Sierra or later</li>
<li>the device using Thunderbolt 3 must provide its power.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="share-disk-on-m1">Share Disk on M1</h4>
<p>I tried different channels and forums, but there was no obvious answer. This took quite an amount of research. By now, I can conclude the following.</p>
<p>Share Disk is very different from Target Disk and is relatively useless for forensic purposes (from what I&rsquo;ve seen now). Unlike its predecessor, Share Disk operates over SMB protocol and is not mounted like a standard drive. <code>Diskutillist</code> (or its GUI version Disk Utility), <a href="https://github.com/aburgh/Disk-Arbitrator">Disk Arbitrator</a> (custom tool) or even <code>ls /dev/ | grep disk</code> won&rsquo;t show it. Its mounting seems not governed by <code>diskarbitrationd</code> (framework for mounting and managing drives). Even though it looks like it&rsquo;s mounted in GUI, different APIs are in place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried creating a file <code>/etc/fstab</code> and using custom settings for mounting my test USB drive: <code>LABEL=&quot;TestDrive&quot; none apfs ro,noauto</code>. This USB device was not automatically mounted; when I mounted it manually, it was in read-only mode (<code>ro</code> option). I did the same for the Macintosh HD, the label for my drive on target MacBook: <code>LABEL=&quot;Macintosh HD&quot; /suspect apfs ro,noauto</code>. Just in case, I acquired the volume&rsquo;s UUID via <code>diskutil info /Volumes/Macintosh\'s\ HD | grep -i uuid</code> from both the recovery mode and when booted normally (which were different).</p>
<p>This is a network share; you have the same rights as the PC user. I don&rsquo;t know if there is any way to control the restrictions here, but at the moment, the most forensically sound way would be to use a physical write blocker. This <a href="https://sumuri.com/how-to-image-an-apple-silicon-mac-with-recon-itr-live/">tool</a> from SUMURI is for Live acquisition only. And the page on the forum <a href="https://www.forensicfocus.com/forums/general/apple-silicon-m1-chip-based-computers/">here</a> has been updated a while ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgfYuuAUU8A">Here</a> is a video from SUMURI experts on the imaging issues, mentioning the Shared Disk mode. I am curious to know how they make it forensically sound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⛔️ I could not make the whole thing work. I even thought there might be some problem with the genuine Apple cables.
✍🏻 However, in my case, the issue appears very primitive. The problem was that both my MacBooks had the same name. The airDrop was smart enough to rename one by appending (2), but it seems it was not easy in this mode. Once I named the PCs differently, it all started to work. Also, I’ve changed the HDD names, just in case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>❗️This option is not a write-proof one. I managed to delete a folder from the drive. Make sure the write blocker is on.</p>

<p>🧪 What if I could make a Kali USB bootable drive and boot into macOS from it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec7d92dc49f/web">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec7d92dc49f/web</a>

<p>This could be an option to make a raw image of Apple drive. This option will have other complications, like decrypting the drive, dealing with Fusion Drives and parsing APFS containers. But at least it would make the dead acquisition possible. Since there are arm versions of Kali and Kali has dd preinstalled and <code>gpart</code>, this is a good start.</p>
<p>One of the concerns published on <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/439027/boot-from-usb-kali-linux-m1-silicon">StackOverflow</a> was that such functionality as Bluetooth and WiFi would not work. However, this would be even better for forensically sound acquisition.</p>
<p>As per the information from the Internet (in many places), macOS with M1 doesn&rsquo;t support external boot.</p>
<h3 id="vm">VM</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;]they all need to be backed by a disk image, which is a file that represents an entire raw physical disk. If forensic investigator finds themselves having to work with a VM in an investigation, the very fact that the disk is already an image file can be very advantageous. By their very nature, all forensic collections of VM drive images happen by way of a live acquisition, unless of course they are included in a wider powered-off imaging of the hypervisor’s storage. Once the investigator has located the virtual machine to be acquired using the hypervisor management software, they can determine the path to the machine’s disk image(s) (typically a <code>.vmdk</code> format file). Most hypervisors feature a function called ‘snapshotting’ which allows the VM disk image to be frozen in time. For instance, if a snapshot is triggered in VMware ESXi, a commonly used commercial hypervisor platform, a new copy of the disk image is created, writes are prevented on the original copy and the new image gets promoted to being the primary image in use. Essentially this is a software-based write blocker built right into the platform. This is perfect for incident response; the cost in terms of time and hardware when it comes to creating a snapshot for deeper examination is minimal. Of course, we need to stay on top of things to ensure that this step is completed – the flexibility of VMs means it can be just as quick to recreate the VM from scratch, disregarding any potential evidence. <a href="#1">1</a></p>
