    <p>First, have a template for an IR/forensics sheet. This can be done in Excel or other program alike. You can list all the evidence and hint and leads to follow there. It&rsquo;s better to specify the machine that contained that evidence, the command and program used to find it, path to the evidence, why you think it&rsquo;s suspicious etc. You may divide leads, host indicators, network indicators on separate sheets.</p>
<h2 id="image-info">Image Info</h2>
<p>Use <code>sleuthkit</code> to gather some information. <code>mmstat &lt;disk_or_image&gt;</code> shows volume type. I&rsquo;ve ran this command, but as I can conclude by the output, it&rsquo;s not volume type, but rather a partition schema. I wonder, if these are the same things. <code>mmls -t &lt;partition_schema&gt; &lt;disk_or_image&gt;</code> shows the disk layout including unallocated space. Actually, no need to pass <code>&lt;partition_schema&gt;</code>, it&rsquo;s determined by the tool. Hence, no need to run <code>mmstat</code>. From the <code>mmls</code> we need to note the partition offset to use it with outher tools. For example, <code>fsstat -o &lt;offset&gt; &lt;disk_or_image&gt;</code> shows very detailed information about a partition. The output depends on the file system. For Linux 🐧 partitions it&rsquo;ll show informationn about inodes etc. For NTFS - about NTFS metadata, for exFAT - FAT1 and Root directory. The same information but more detailed can be viewed with 🛠 Active@Disk Editor. To view deleted files: <code>fls -o &lt;offset&gt; &lt;disk_or_image&gt;</code>. To export a timeline from the volume - <code>fls -r -m &quot;/&quot; -o &lt;offset&gt; &lt;disk_or_image&gt; &gt; bodyfile.txt</code> (<code>-r</code> - recursive, <code>-m</code> - use <code>mactime</code> input format to use with another tool, <code>\</code> - mount point question mark ❓). To create timeline, run <code>mactime.pl -b &lt;bodyfile&gt; -d &gt; timeline.csv</code> [<a href="">1</a>]. To specify timezone, add <code>-z</code> switch.</p>

<h2 id="malware-analysis">Malware Analysis</h2>
<p><em>🔍 What are we looking for?</em> Persistence / start-up mechanisms, running processes and remnants left.</p>
<p>There is a good methodology to follow in order to find suspicious programs at the larger scale.</p>
<h3 id="auto-runs-locations">Auto Runs locations</h3>
<p>🗒 <em>Explore common autorun locations in order to find the files that are automatically run at startup.</em></p>
<p>👣 <strong>For a Windows machine</strong>. Registry keys: For <code>SOFTWARE</code> hive (system wide) and <code>NTUSER.dat</code> (user-specific): <code>Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>, <code>Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>. Read more about it in Windows registry article. <code>SOFTWARE</code> hive also has <code>Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\Run and Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Winlogon\Userinit</code>. File system: <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code>. I would also check running processes on the live system to see which processes were started at system start up (time launched is too close to <code>winlogon</code> for example, or any other core process that starts at boot).</p>
<p>👣 <strong>For a macOS machine</strong>. <code>System Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Groups -&gt; Login Items</code>. Additional: SDF podcast.</p>
<p>🗒 <em>Among these entried find suspicious ones.</em></p>
<p>How to determine if it&rsquo;s malicious? Well, the sure way is only to reverse engineer it, but it is time consuming. So, you need to narrow down the candidates first. There are a couple of indicators that are commonly seen in malware.</p>
<p><strong>Hash</strong>. The first and dummiest way, but highly suggested is to check the file hash against VirusTotal database. This way you&rsquo;ll eliminate <strong>known good</strong> files, since it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that a legitimate software like Windows files have never been checked so far. Also, this way you can find <strong>known bad</strong>.</p>
<p>📝 Put the suspicious files down into your IR/forensics sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Name/Path</strong>. In order to spot deviations at that point you need to have a firm understanding of what&rsquo;s normal for that particular system. There are some common &ldquo;normalities&rdquo; for different OSes, of course, as well. You can refer to SANS poster &ldquo;Find Evil&rdquo; which is often updated, SDF Podcast of Michael Leclair about Windows Core Processes, or find the corresponding article about core processes and system supernova in the Technical Reference section of this website.</p>

<p>❓ <em>What A/V solution is being used?</em> 🦠 🛑 If it&rsquo;s Windows, there might be just Windows Defender or some third-party AV. Find the logs for this particular AV solution. More <a href="/docs/dfir/host/windows/windows-artifacts#av-logs">here</a> about this Windows artifact. As for macOS, it has a built-in gatekeeper which logs all these alerts and can even detect known malware.

<h4 id="persistance">Persistance</h4>
<p>Different groups have prefered persistence mechanisms. Persistance mechanisms:</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
<p>The executable needs to have certain code and permissions for service behaviour and there are three options to acomplish that:</p>
<ul>
<li>New service</li>
<li>Hijacking. Required modifications to some existing service. Example: GlassRAT</li>
<li>Service failure recovery. DrWatson?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Remnants that it was <strong>started</strong>. AutoRuns, schedule scripts, Run, RunOnce etc.</li>
<li>Remnants that it was <strong>running</strong>. Depends on the process. IOC (Indicator of Compromise). File artifacts, network cache (based on past incidents). Memory - unallocated memory that contains malware signatures.</li>
<li>Remnants that it was <strong>shutdown</strong>. Program Ended Artifact Category: name + time + reason*. Event logs, audit logs (not enabled by default).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-list">Key list</h4>
<ul>
<li>Suspicious name or path</li>
<li>Exes or libs for the program are found? Are they malicious?</li>
<li>Time corresponds to the incident time?</li>
<li>Crashed? Did it crash before? Does it have known vulnerabilities?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cyber Triage uses WinAPI to answer questions about malware. Also uses SleuthKit to answer questions about rootkits.  Can work on memory image and run different volatility modules in UI.</p>

<p>These characteristics MIGHT be of a malware, but not neccessarilly. These are just some clues and advices.</p>
<h3 id="runtime-linking">Runtime linking</h3>
<p>Since static linking is rare (it increases the body of a program) and dynamicly linked functions can be inspected in different ways, runtime linking might be a choice for malware authors to hide the functionality. How to determine if the runtime linking is used?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❓Windows, Mac, Linux?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<p><strong>Importing</strong> and using <code>GetProcessAddress</code>/<code>LdrGetProcessAddress</code> or/and <code>LoadLibrary</code>/<code>LdrLoadDll</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❓ For Mac and Linux?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
<p>Check <strong>strings</strong> in <code>Image</code> and in <code>Memory</code> using the corresponding radio button on the <code>Strings</code> tab of a selected process info in Process Explorer. If they differ - process replacement tool place.</p>
<h3 id="32bit-code">32bit Code</h3>
<p>Since malware authors usually want their software to work on as many machines as possible, they often compile <strong>32bit code</strong>. That&rsquo;s not a decent indicator by itself, but it&rsquo;s a good additional score.</p>
<h3 id="signed-code">Signed Code</h3>
<p>Around 3% of malware is <strong>signed</strong>. It&rsquo;s due to the fact that some systems require executables to be signed. But this technique is not very good for malware authors since when at least one &ldquo;product&rdquo; is marked as malicious, all code that was signed with the same certificate will be identified as well. 🛠 Use <code>sigcheck</code> to check signatures and hashes against Virus Total.</p>
<h3 id="packed-executables">Packed Executables</h3>
<p><strong>Packed executables</strong> are almoust 100% indicator that the author didn&rsquo;t want his treasure to be reverse engineered. Why could this be? Because it&rsquo;s some software with a portion of client-side code that performs sensitive operations. One example of a legitimate software is a program that generates OTP codes. There are several ways to determine that a file is packed. The first one - using enthropy analysis against the file. Consider, that most program epilogues start with <code>55 8B EC</code> (<code>push ebp mov ebp, esp</code>) and end with <code>c3</code> (<code>ret</code>).  That means that the number of both in one executable should be relatively the same. Compressed files don&rsquo;t compress well. Another example is to pack the file and determine, how efficiently was it packed. If it wasn&rsquo;t possible to pack the file too much, it&rsquo;s probable that the file is already packed. 🛠 Use the first method with <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD">PEiD</a> (GUI Windows tool), use the second method with <code>densityscan</code> (commercial cross-platform tool).</p>
<h3 id="pe-sections">PE Sections</h3>
<p>Weired names for <strong>PE sections</strong>. PE sections (for Windows) are usually <code>text</code>, <code>bss</code>, <code>data</code> etc. If you some gibberish that&rsquo;s not usually seen here, most likely the executable is packed.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-vs-physical-addresses">Virtual vs Physical Addresses</h3>
<p><strong>VA vs PA</strong>. Empty Physical addresses for sections (while VA are not empty). More about virtual and physical addresses in the reverse engineering section.</p>

<li>If it&rsquo;s a dll, it can be still ran independently.  Though there are no guaratees, there are two ways to acomplish that (either can work for you):
<ul>
<li>use <code>rundll32</code> (<code>rundll32 [dllname].dll, [function name or ordeal]</code>). Example, a <code>malware.dll</code> that has a function <code>InstallService</code> which requires an argument service name. We want to launch it, call this function to create a service with name &ldquo;MaliciousService&rdquo;: <code>rundll32 malware.dll, MaliciousService</code>. In Dependency Walker we can peek the function&rsquo;s ordeal and run this command like this (if the ordeal is, say, 5): <code>rundll32 malware.dll, #5</code>.</li>
<li>patch PE header of the dll + changing its extension. <code>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER</code> -&gt; <code>CHARACTERISTICS</code> &ndash;&gt; <code>IMAGE_FILE_DLL</code> flag <code>0x2000</code> set to <code>0x0000</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ServiceMain</code> without any <code>Install</code> function.
<ul>
<li>Use <code>sc</code> command</li>
<li><code>HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet\Services</code> - modify the registry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interesting-places-to-check">Interesting places to check</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>.rsrc</code> section usually contains such resources as icons, pictires etc. However, some malicious programs (as well as legitimate ones) can store a driver or other code there which gets extracted and executed by the main progam flow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="naming-conventions">Naming conventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Windows systems some functions have a suffix <code>A</code> or <code>W</code>. These indicate that this function accepting ASCII or wide character string as an argument respectively.</li>
<li>On Windows systems some functions have a suffix <code>Ex</code> or even <code>ExEx</code>. These indicate that Windows has released a new version of a function which is not compatible with older ones, since older ones must be supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-find-out-">How to find out &hellip;</h2>
<ul>
<li>&hellip; which processes used a certain dll ❓ In <a href="/docs/toolkit/general/reverse-toolkit/#process-explorer">Process Explorer</a> choose <code>Find Handle or DLL</code>.</li>
<li>&hellip; if a DLL is loaded into a process after load time ❓ Compare the DLL list in <a href="/docs/toolkit/general/reverse-toolkit/#process-explorer">Process Explorer</a> to the imports shown in <a href="/docs/toolkit/general/reverse-toolkit/#dependency-walker">Dependency Walker</a>.</li>
<li>&hellip; if a <code>.doc</code> or <code>.pdf</code> or another document is malicious ❓ Open <a href="/docs/toolkit/general/reverse-toolkit/#process-explorer">Process Explorer</a>, launch the suspicios doc in sandboxed environment and check whether it has spawned any processes. Open this process&rsquo;s <code>Properties</code> window, <code>Image</code> tab to check the location of the malware file.</li>

<h2 id="user-activity">User Activity</h2>
<p>Actually, as I read further an further, it seems that everything is about a user. But!</p>
<p>A user can be of several categories. I&rsquo;ll name each one as shortly as I can to refer to them in future. But I will describe them in more detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate user, who has done something bad by accident</strong>. Let&rsquo;s call him a <strong>dummy</strong> 😬. I&rsquo;ve been there, I once changed permissions to <code>Deny</code> for my admin account to disk <code>C</code> on Windows and could do nothing about it later. How stupid was it 🙈? My excuse is that I only started with PCs&hellip; .</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate user, who has done something bad by intent.</strong> Let&rsquo;s call this one a <strong>poopy</strong> 💩. Say, he or she feels highy underpaid and sells company&rsquo;s kitty plans to some evil dog hackers.</p>
<p><strong>A user created and used by a hacker.</strong> This one I will call a <strong>sheep</strong> 🐑  as in <em>A wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing</em>, since the attacker is trying mask itself as something good.  This one is not unusual, but I guess, easily determined by the sysadmin. However, there are some cases, when an attacker can change view permissions for his/her account on AD so that no one will see this user.</p>
<p><strong>A user created legitimately, but compromised by a hacker and doing something by intent.</strong> This one will be a <strong>donkey</strong> 🦓, as the attaker is using another account for his ride. I guess it&rsquo;s the most common when the hackers are in the picture.</p>
<p>And here are the questions we will have to answer during investigations, that can help in distinguishing between these types.</p>
<h3 id="dummy--vs-poopy-"><strong>Dummy</strong> 😬 vs <strong>Poopy</strong> 💩</h3>
<p><em>❓ How to prove that the person didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose, but by accident?</em></p>
<p>✍️ It&rsquo;s often not enough just to find a file on a system. One needs to prove <strong>the intent</strong>. Remember to use more than one artifact whenever possible! For example, the user may be insisting that he or she did not download this file. But, if the browser was set to flush data every 7 days and the timestamps for the deleted file shows it was deleted an hour after it was deleted - this might raiser some reasonable doubt think 🤔. Or, the file was wiped 🧹 (it&rsquo;s contents filled with <code>0</code>s). If one didn&rsquo;t know it existed, why delete it? Or there is no data on the PC indicating the use of the file, but it was continuously downloaded/uploaded according to the server logs. ⚠️ This, however, won&rsquo;t prove that there was no hacker in place!</p>
<h3 id="sheep--vs-others---and-"><strong>Sheep</strong> 🐑 vs <strong>others</strong> 💩, 😬 and 🦓</h3>
<p>✍️ <strong>Are there suspicious accounts?</strong> 👣 SAM reg hive (local and domain). Even if the account is deleted, then you can still spot it: user directory sometimes is retained and also check logs. The below question may help finding a malicious user (hacker). More <a href="/docs/dfir/forensic-investigation/accounts">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> User Name does not match conventions for this organisation?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Weird priviledges</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Scope (local or domain)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Creation time and date.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poopy--vs-donkey-"><strong>Poopy</strong> 💩 vs <strong>donkey</strong> 🦓</h3>
<p><em>❓ How to prove that the account was compromised?</em></p>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s of attacks involve account compromise. In some cases malware is not even needed. There are several arguments for the defence: <em>I didn&rsquo;t know</em>, <em>It was not me</em>, <em>It was a malware</em> and <em>It happened accidently</em>.</p>
<p>✍️ <strong>Suspicious logins?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Should this user use this account?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Are they new to the computer?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> If remote, does the account usually come from that computer?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Is the time expected?</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Does the account have lots of failed logins? 👉 <em>A very strong indicator of compromise</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> A login during time when the user was absent 👉 <em>A very strong indicator of compromise</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✍️ <strong>Malware</strong>. There is a separate section for malware above ☝️, but it can be a strong defense for some one claiming his or her account was compromised. But! ⚠️ Even if there is a malware found, it&rsquo;s essential to prove that it existed at the time that some investigated activity took place.</p>
<h3 id="poopy--and-donkey--vs-others--and-"><strong>Poopy</strong> 💩 and <strong>donkey</strong> 🦓 vs <strong>others</strong> 😬 and 🐑</h3>
<p>✍️ <strong>Suspicious activity?</strong></p>

<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Was it a result of a redirect (300 HTTP or header redirect, or pop-up) 👉 <em>May help the defending side if this can be proved.</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> File accessed soon after creation? 👉 <em>Might be an indicator of some automated task, or not&hellip;.</em>.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Was a file deleted/wiped? 👉 <em>File wiped is a strong indiator of intent.</em> 🛠 Directory Snoop can show that the file was wiped, not simply deleted. Not all wiping software clears the <code>$MFT</code> table.</li>

<h3 id="mail">Mail</h3>
<p>❗️❗️❗️❗️ Link to collection.</p>
<p>First, determine all the mail clients used. That will help to determine the file paths to search for mails. Then, determine relevant threads. How? One option is to use <code>strings</code> + <code>grep</code>. If the mail client uses a <code>db</code> file type to store information, craft SQL queries wisely. Be careful with the keyword search though, since not all relevant emails might contains them.</p>
<p>You may also make use of some forensics framework (like Autopsy 🐕). This tool and other alike can parse email data from disk or disk image and present information about conversations, people in a more comfortable way. Another framework that used (trial version) - Magnet AXIOM, a great tool, but it&rsquo;s not free, so, not for individual investigators, students and researches with limited resources.</p>
<p>🛠 EMT (Email Mining Toolkit) is not maintained anymore but the idea was to group emails with similar bahvioral characteristics. The following techniques were used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stationary User Profiles. Compare PC user activity with email activity.</li>
<li>Similar Users. Collect information about normal user activity. Deviated accs are suspicious.</li>
<li>Attachment statistics.</li>
<li>Recipient Frequency. Certain users receive certain email with some known consistency.</li>
<li>Group Communications. Same last names - family. A group with different last names receiving one email - business org, club or spam target.</li>
</ul>
<p>⚒️ ContentAnalysis developed this idea further and several software employed this technique: Agilex, AnyDoc, Datacap, dtSearch, elVia, eLumicor, Fastline Technologies (data mining), H&amp;A eDiscovery, iConnect, kCura (electronic discovery), Planet Data, SAIC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, make sure that the source IP is a valid one ( 🛠 <code>nslookup</code> will help). Additional info can be acquired with <code>whois</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="network-triage">Network Triage</h3>
<p>Ports idetify services (usually, but not always).</p>
<ul>
<li>System ports are forensically important <code>0-1023</code>.</li>
<li>User ports <code>1024-49151</code></li>
<li>Private <code>49152</code>-last</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheatsheets for known ports <a href="https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Private IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>10.0.0.0 - 10.55.55.55</li>
<li>17x.0.0.0</li>
<li>19x.0.0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of notable ports and IP addresses. Look for open connections.</p>
<p><code>netstat -boan</code> statistics and current tcp connections along with the exe, listening port and PID. For Mac OS netstat there is no <code>-o</code> switch, so I&rsquo;ve used <code>netstat -ban</code>.</p>
<p>Filter out internal addresses (they are not interesting initially). Check the remote connections. Check executables that launched these connections, also look for port-services mismatch or unusual ports or services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>📝 Make a list of processes and connections of several clean systems for &ldquo;known-good&rdquo; reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example of suspicious case: java listening on port <code>53</code> which is normally used by DNS service. FF using <code>3389</code> port (which is for remote connections). <code>44999</code> (used for private internal connections) some strange executable.</p>
<p>Windows Security Event Log <code>5156</code> is triggered when a network connection is allowed. 4688 - new process starting.</p>

<p>PID, Application field (path to the executable and exe name), Inbound/Outboun, sport/dport, addresses (src and dst), protocol field.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t see some event ids that you are supposed to, then try turning on all auditin policy using <code>secpol.msc</code> or going to <code>Start -&gt; Windows Administrative Tools -&gt; Local Security Policy</code>. In the opened window then go to <code>Local Policies</code> and choose <code>Audit Policy</code>. Either turn on each of them or turn on the ones that you think are responsible I was able to star capturing event 5156. I was using Vbox with Windows Server 2019 installed and the machine promoted to DC (Active Directory Feauture installed).</p>
<p>Frequency analysis.</p>
<p>Block event codes.</p>
<p>Filter the record to indentify external IP addresses with which the PC is commincating. Then check external IPs reputations for suspicious using, for example, <code>hostintel</code>.</p>
<p>To use <a href="https://github.com/keithjjones/hostintel">hostintel</a>, install it following the instructions on GitHub. Then install geoip2 using  <code>pip install &quot;geoip2==3.0.0&quot; </code>. I got an error that <code>geoip.database</code> was not installed when I installed it with <code>pip install geoip2</code> or from GitHub. This module is for working with GeoIP databases.</p>
<p>To actually use these databases (one is included with the tool, but it mught get outdated), signup <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases">here</a> and download GeoLite2 City from <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/410417/geoip/downloads">here</a>. This is an archive, unpack it and put the *.mmb file in <code>hostintel/data</code> folder (replace). These dbs are used by other tools as well, so you might want to keep it elsewhere and change its path in config.</p>
<p>Also, about the config. Edit this config - <code>hostintel/sampleconfig.conf</code>. By default, only GeoLite2 City is used, but you can add your free public API keys from different threat intelligence resources like VirusTotal, Censys, OTX, Passive Total or/and Shodan. You might want to rename it more appropriately, like <code>config.conf</code> or <code>aliens-are-among-us.conf</code> 👽. But keep in mind the name of the config, whatever it is, to run the tool.</p>
<p>For running the tool, you&rsquo;ll also need to create a file with a list of IPs. I&rsquo;ve created a file <code>i.txt</code> in the <code>hostintel</code> directory and so my command was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">python hostintel.py config.conf i.txt
</code></pre></div><p>How frequently is the host connecting to another machine? For how long? May be it is something legitimate. But if it&rsquo;s recent or/and not regular - might be an indicator.</p>
<p>Look for unusual application names of paths, typos or pokerhand ports (<code>44488</code> <code>12345</code> or alike). Or may some gibberish names. Unusual protocols - <code>1</code> (ICMP) <code>6</code> (TCP) <code>70</code> (UDP). Look for the ports outside of these three.</p>
