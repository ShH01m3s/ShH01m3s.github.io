    <p><em>Below are the techniques, tools and instructions regarding data recovery from various file systems and devices. Most of the below techniques apply to HDDs only. Those that are for SDDs or other flash memory devices will be specified in the last section.</em></p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>There are several ways to recover deleted data. Some of them will vary for different file systems.</p>
<p>When data is deleted from a flash drive/SSD, all transistors are set to &ldquo;off&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t mean though that data gets <em>deleted</em> the moment it was deleted by the user. Flash memory has a controller with a TRIM function and garbage collector. [<a href="">3</a>]</p>
<h2 id="carving">Carving</h2>
<p>Carving is something that can be used for any file system. There are two methods for carving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block-based. Starts with a known header, examines each block and validates it, whether it could be the part of the file using data modeling. 🛠 Foremost (combines both methods)</li>
<li>Header/footer. Use search string engine to scan unallocated space for known headers. Then, looks for the first occurence of a footer. 🛠 Foremost (combines both methods), Scalpel.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several prerequisited though:</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> The header should be intact</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> The file should not be fragmented (different parts on different parts of the disk)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="foremost">Foremost</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">foremost -t jpeg, tif, bmp - &lt;image/disk&gt; -o &lt;result_dir&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="scalpel">Scalpel</h3>
<p>Carver-recovery (aka Scalpel) looks for headers and footers. Scans the image/disk twice. First, it reads in 10MB chunks (default) loggin every header and footer. On the second pass, uses indexes created to collect files.</p>
<h3 id="photorec">PhotoRec</h3>
<h2 id="recovering-registry-entries">Recovering Registry Entries</h2>
<p>Since the registry is unique to Windows systems, the following technique only applies to them. Registry has both unallocated space and unallocated deleted keys.</p>
<p>Use <code>deleted.pl</code>. Example: <code>deleted.pl SAM &gt; /cases/winforensics/SAM_recovered.txt</code>. Or use <a href="https://tzworks.com/prototype_page.php?proto_id=3">YARU</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fat32-recovery">FAT32 Recovery</h2>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p>First, get familiar with the FAT file system. There are some things specific to this FS in the way the files are created and deleted. We basically need to follow the file deletion steps in the reversed order.</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Change <code>0xE5</code> values in the directory entry set</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Change FAT table values to indicate allocated (not <code>0x00000000</code>)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Use the short file name directory entry (starting cluster and file size)
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Determine the cluster size using the volume boot record data</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Calculate the number of clusters needed (<code>int clusters = file_size / cluster_size</code>). Keep in mind, that file size for folders is always <code>00 00 00 00</code>. So, don&rsquo;t confuse a file with a folder.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Rechain FAT entries of the file</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>🔎 Intrestingly enough, this method worked on a FAT32 formatted flash drive. Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ If the file was fragmented (i.e. the clusters are not contiguous) it&rsquo;s going to be harder to recover the file.</p>
<p>⚠️ If the directory entry OR/AND the data itself was overwritten - it will be impossible to recover the file. However, if the directory entry was overwritten, but the data itself was not - you can try to recover the file contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-1-recovering-a-small-file-in-a-folder">Example 1. Recovering a small file in a folder</h3>
<p><strong>The first step in recovering a gile is to change <code>0xE5</code> values in the directory entry set. That&rsquo;s what we are about to do.</strong></p>
<p>First, load the flash drive into Active@Disk Editor or another tool that allows viewing the raw contents of partitions and volumes. The below instructions are given for the Active@Disk Editor. You may use them for other similar tools however.</p>
<p>Active@Disk Editor loads the FAT32 formatted disk/partition at the start of FAT32 boot record by default. Note the cluster size. In my case there are 8 sectors per cluster and each sector is 512 bytes (both marked with a purple rectangle on the picture below both in hex on the right and in window to the left).</p>
<p>Navigate to the root directory first (the list of files and folders in the root directory) either by clicking <code>Naviagate &gt; Root Directory</code> or going to the second cluster (Root directory is always at the second cluster. In case you forget the location of a root directory, you may also click <code>Root cluster</code> field value in the left part of the window when the FAT32 boot record template is applied:</p>
<p><img src="fat-root-cluster.png" alt="fat-root-cluster"></p>
<p>Once we get to the root directory, we need to find our folder&rsquo;s entry. Keep in mind that the size indicated in the short file name entry of a folder will always be <code>00 00 00 00</code>. Also, the attributes will also indicate <code>0x10</code> (directory). Choose <code>FAT directory entry</code> in the template list (marked with a blue rectangle on the picture above) if it was not chosen automatically. Find the short file name of the folder. In my case <code>NEWFOL~1</code> (the last one). Right-click and choose <code>Set template position</code> here. Click the entry to apply the highlighting. Read the low word and the high word for the first cluster number (the high word is marked with orange 🍊 on the picture below and the low word - in blue 🐬).</p>
<p><img src="fat-low-high-cluster.png" alt="fat-low-high-cluster"></p>
<p>Each value is to be converted to little-endian: <code>0x06 0x00</code> becomes <code>0x0006</code> and <code>0x0000</code> remains the same. Now combine the two: <code>0x00000006</code>.  Click <code>Go to sector</code> on the top pane, convert the value to decimal or enter it in hex with <code>0x</code> prefix. In my case, <code>0x06</code>. Click Enter. This will throw you right to this folder&rsquo;s contents (list of files and nested folders). In my case, there is only on user-created file there (+1 user-created file deleted).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🤬 If the field for the cluster number is not active</p>
<p>✍️ &hellip;, try reloading the drive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Locate the short file name, then locate all the long file names above it. In case the file is not deleted, it would be until you find the long file enrty starting with <code>4</code> (see the example below).</p>
<p><img src="fat-new-folder-contents.png" alt="fat-new-folder-contents"></p>
<p>However, since the files are deleted, the first nibble for each entry in the set is <code>E5</code> now. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll need to find the last long entry by looking at the file name and looking for extension. Another method would be to look at the <code>0x0A</code> offset and read until you see the last case of <code>0x0F</code> (marked with a purple rectangle is the next entry which is not a LFN since it&rsquo;s vlaue at offset <code>0x0A</code> is <code>0x20</code>). In my case, there are only two long file names. Right click at the beginning of the last long file name and choose <code>Set template position</code>. You&rsquo;ll see something like the below picture. Highlighed in yellow is the short file name, two entries above it (green and red) are for the long file names. All the three start with <code>0xE5</code>.</p>
<p><img src="fat-new-folder-contents-deleted.png" alt="fat-new-folder-contents-deleted"></p>
<p>Note that structure of this file set is broken and Active@Disk Editor can&rsquo;t find the end of it, but we know where it is (marked with a blue rectangle).</p>
<p>Now click the short file name entry is broken (the first character is unknown, remember it&rsquo;s now <code>0xE5</code>). This is where the LFN entry will come in handy. In the long file name entry the first byte doesn&rsquo;t indicate a file name character, but a status byte. That&rsquo;s why the file name was unchanged (the second byte of the LFN) and is equal to <code>0x4E</code>. Now we now, what was the first byte of the SFN entry (short file name entry).</p>
<p>Now, lets fix the first bytes of each entry in the set. Thanks to the LFN, we know the first character of the file name and thus - the first byte of the SFN. So, the first byte of the SFN is <code>0x4E</code> (ASCII <code>N</code>). Now, we know that there are just two LFN entries above it, and the second is the last. So, the first one&rsquo;s first byte should be <code>0x01</code> and the second one - <code>0x42</code> (the last entry in the set starts with <code>4</code>, remember?). These changes are marked with a green circle on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="fat-dir-entries-recovery.png" alt="fat-dir-entries-recovery"></p>
<p>Now, to the next step. <strong>The next step is to change FAT table values to indicate allocated (not <code>0x00000000</code>).</strong></p>
<p>We note the number of the first cluster and the file size. In the picture below, the first cluster for the file is <code>0x00000007</code> (little-endian, remember?). The file size is <code>0x00000010</code> (little-endian again, so you flip all the bytes), 16 bytes (decimal).</p>
<p><img src="fat-sfn-deleted-location.png" alt="fat-sfn-deleted-location"></p>
<p>We know from the volume boot record that 1 cluster contains 8 sectors, each 512 bytes. Since the file occupies 16 bytes, it is much smaller than 1 sector. So, it occupies 1 cluster. So, we don&rsquo;t need to worry about chains in FAT1 and FAT2. Now, the first cluster is the 7th one. Let&rsquo;s go to the FAT1 and find the entry for the 7th file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🧪 When I looked at the 7th cluster in the FAT1, it still had the value <code>0xFFFFFF0F</code>, which means that the file was not deallocated. I thought that might have been a bug and restarted Active@Disk Editor. However, the value remained unchanged. I&rsquo;ve checked several times that the file was indeed deleted permanently (yes it was). I then created a file in the root directory and deleted it, restarted Active@Disk Editor and checked the FAT1: the cluster for this file was zeroed. Might it be so, that the files are deallocated only when the folder is the root or the folder is deleted?</p>
<p>✍️ It looks like the flash drive was mounted to macOS at some point (not the Windows VM). macOS writes its own meta crap 💩, so my deleted file&rsquo;s contents (not the directory entry) was overwritten! How I&rsquo;ve figured that? Well, I have fixed the SFN and the LFN. The FAT1 I have left untouched, since it&rsquo;s already marked as allocated. The file appeared in the folder, but it&rsquo;s contents was esoteric:</p>
<p><img src="fat-esoteric.png" alt="fat-esoteric"></p>
<p>Since the file contents was supposed to be at cluster 7, I&rsquo;ve opened it in Active@Disk Editor at analysed the contents:</p>
<p><img src="fat-new-contents.png" alt="fat-new-contents"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not the things I wrote. Besides, observe the first 32 bytes starting with <code>2E</code> and the second 32 bytes, starting with <code>2E 2E</code>. This a FAT directory. Then the files that it contains: <code>Volume Configuration.plist</code> and <code>Store-v2</code>. The <code>plist</code> extension tells me that it&rsquo;s a macOS config file. So, that&rsquo;s what happens if the file contents overwritten but its directory entries are not! 😃</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the above story, I had to create and delete another file <code>New Document (2).txt</code> in the same folder. The SFN and LFN entries were fixed in the same manner:</p>
<p><img src="fat-newdoc2-recovered1.png" alt="fat-newdoc2-recovered1"></p>
<p>This time the cluster number was <code>0x0A</code> (10 in decimal). We navigate to FAT1 and find this cluster in the list. For better accessibly you may set bytes per line to 4 in Preferences (since each entry is 4 bytes long). We skip the first two entries (they stand for media desscriptor and FAT version) and start counting from 2 (the first entry is cluster 2). We find the cluster:</p>
<p><img src="fat-10th-sector-dealloc.png" alt="fat-10th-sector-dealloc"></p>
<p>Change these <code>00 00 00 00</code> to <code>FF FF FF 0F</code>.</p>
<p><img src="fat-fat1-fixed-file2.png" alt="fat-fat1-fixed-file2"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s save the changes:</p>
<p><img src="fat-recovery-save.png" alt="fat-recovery-save"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔎 What if the file&rsquo;s SFN and LFN are fixed but the FAT1 entries are not? Well, the file will be visible, but if you try opening it, you&rsquo;ll get the below error:</p>
<p><img src="fat-corrupt-file.png" alt="fat-corrupt-file"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s check the file in File Explorer:</p>
<p><img src="fat-recovery-result.png" alt="fat-recovery-result"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back 😁!</p>

<h2 id="ntfs-file-recovery">NTFS File Recovery</h2>
<h3 id="steps-1">Steps</h3>
<p>To get familiar with NTFS file creation and deletion, see <a href="/docs/dfir/data-storage/file-systems/ntfs#file-creation-and-deletion">here</a>. In general, there are resident and non-resident files. Resident files are small and have their contents in the MFT record itself. Non-resident files are bigger and their contents is stored elsewhere on the disk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Since MFT records get reused once they are deallocated on the first-free basis, resident files get overwritten sooner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For resident files, use a regular expression for finding <code>FILE0</code> records: <code>\x46\x49\x4C\x45.{18}[\x00\x02]</code> [<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/windows-os-forensics/lecture/VMUiU/ntfs-file-recovery">2</a>]. This will find all the <code>FILE</code> records that are not newly created. Remember, once a file is created its sequence number is <code>01</code>. Whenever the <code>FILE</code> record is deleted (deallocated, it&rsquo;s never actually deleted), the sequence number gets incremented. So, if this record was deallocated once, its sequence number will be <code>0x02</code>. But! This record can be reused multiple times! When I did the lab, one poor record was reused over and over again, and its sequence number got as big as <code>0x08</code>, imagine that! So, I would fix the regular expression above to address these cases: <code>\x46\x49\x4C\x45.{18}^[\x00\x01]</code> (todo).</p>
<p>For a resident file:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Use grep search or a regular expression (may use this feature in Active@Disk Editor) looking for the <code>FILE</code> header. As an alternative, use a keyword search.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Inspect each result and find the file needed and its contents.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>❓ How to <strong>recover</strong> the file?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a non-resident file:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Use a keyword search, or carve using the file header. For example, if it&rsquo;s a <code>docx</code> document, look for <code>50 4B 03 04 14 00 06 00</code>.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Copy the raw data elsewhere. Open with the dedicated application.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>❓ How to <strong>recover</strong> the file?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ When using a keyword search, use Unicode! Unicode is NTFS darling.</p>

<h3 id="example-1-reconvering-a-resident-file">Example 1. Reconvering a resident file</h3>
<p>Below is the file opened in Active@Disk Editor that I created and about to delete. In the first picture we can see the attributes and in the second - file contents. Also, in the second picture note the sector number (marked with a red rectangle). I am not using this data to recover the file, but I will rather use in validation purposes.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m deleting the file.</p>

<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> ❓how many sectors per cluster (offset <code>0x6D</code> in the boot record)? Keep in mind, it a shift value, i.e. you need to raise 2 to this power in order to get the actual number of clusters per sector.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> locate the dir enry set either bu going to the root cluster (in my case, the 4th cluster) and finding the record manually or by clicking <code>Browse File  Records</code> and selecting the folder under examination from the list.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> use the information from the set (file name, size and starting cluster) to carve the file. The stream entry contains this information. Go the cluster specified and list until you either reach the end of the allocated space (using the file size).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the directory entry set got overwritten - carve the file.</p>
<p>If not, you could try reversing the Bitmap bits and the directory entry set first bytes, but generally the above is enough to get the file contents. This of course will not make it appear in the folder again, since for that you&rsquo;d have to manually fix Bitmap, FAT (in case of a fragmented file) and the dir entry set.</p>

<p>🧪 Create and delete files to observe, how the Bitmap gets changed.</p>

<p>🧪 I thought that data deleted from a flash drive is not recoverable. However, I was able to recover files from a FAT32 partitioned drive. Why?</p>
<p>❓ May be it&rsquo;s only until the flash drive is connected to the PC? May be once the power is taken away, the data is wiped?</p>
