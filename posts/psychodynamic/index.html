      <p><em>Psychodynamic psychotherapy is the daughter of classical psychoanalysis and, since its foundation, has spawned children of its own. Let’s debunk some common myths surrounding this approach and demonstrate how much it actually has in common with all modern schools of thought.</em></p>
<h2 id="flavours-of-psychodynamic">Flavours of psychodynamic</h2>
<p>Psychotherapy comes in many flavours, and psychodynamic therapy has its own variations. However, this diversity isn’t limited to the techniques themselves, as both therapists and clients bring something unique to each session. Hence, my experience of the same type of therapy may differ drastically depending on the therapist and the issue I’m struggling with. Nowadays, we have several established psychodynamic approaches one can choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time-limited</li>
<li>Brief</li>
<li>Long-term. This type pf treatment usually takes years and is particularily useful for people who are repeatedly struggling in different areas of their lives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Psychodynamic approaches are all underpinned by several schools of thoughts of psychoanalysis, and the major ones to be aware of are: Freudian, Jungian, Kleinian, Winnicott, Adlerian. The founders of each of those schools have each made a huge contribution to the field, and each one had some interesting perspectives to offer. The diversity of thoughts allows one to choose how to best explain on issue or another. I also feel there is so much sense in all of them, that it&rsquo;s only natural to find a way to unify them all.</p>
<h2 id="psychodynamic-and-other-approaches">Psychodynamic and other approaches</h2>
<p>Psychodynamic therapy is, of course, not the only one there is. Take, for instance, person-centred, congitive, congitive-behavioural, behavioural, narrative, solution-focused, motivational interviewing, to name a few. Interestingly, whenever I read about any of those approaches, I can&rsquo;t help but notice how much in common they all have, despite the quibbling about their illusory differences.</p>
