      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basically, all of the artefacts that are listed in the Investigation section fall under the category &amp;ldquo;user activity&amp;rdquo; one way or another. Even if some process spawned some other process, somewhere in the past the user interaction was still required. That&amp;rsquo;s why I find it so hard to find the perfect categorization. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to devote this section to common strategies of how one would investigate user activity and which artefacts they would use at what point in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
